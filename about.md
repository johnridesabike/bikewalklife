I’ve been a bike enthusiast for several years now. I ride my bicycle to and from work on most days, and I’ve done this while living in one of the most car-dominated cities, in one of the most car-dominated regions, in the world. Even though bike advocates will tell you that riding bicycles is liberating, I can attest that such a counter-cultural lifestyle is not easy.

The name _Bike Walk Life_ comes from the idea that an ideal life is full of plenty of both. Our culture's dominant, backwards philosophy says that a “normal” person’s life revolves around vehicles, and that walking and biking (outside of designated parks) is even dangerous and should be discouraged.

_Bike Walk Life_ is about individuals and communities that reject the ideas of car-culture and celebrate lives on foot or on pedals. I hope you get something out of this blog, and please feel free to fill out the contact form if you have any comments or feedback.
