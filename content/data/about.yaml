intro: "<p>Hi, this is John. I created this blog to curate news and voices from the
  world of biking and walking. I especially focus on the Southeast U.S.</p>"
body: "<p>I’ve been a bike enthusiast for several years now. I ride my bicycle to
  and from work on most days, and I’ve done this while living in one of the most car-dominated
  cities, in one of the most car-dominated regions, in the world. Even though bike
  advocates will tell you that riding bicycles is liberating, I can attest that such
  a counter-cultural lifestyle is not easy.</p><p>The name <em>Bike Walk Life</em>
  comes from the idea that an ideal life is full of plenty of both. Our culture's
  dominant, backwards philosophy says that a “normal” person’s life revolves around
  vehicles, and that walking and biking (outside of designated trails) is even dangerous
  and should be discouraged.</p><p><em>Bike Walk Life</em> is about individuals and
  communities that reject the ideas of car-centric society and celebrate lives on
  foot or on pedals. I hope you get something out of this blog, and please feel free
  to fill out the contact form if you have any comments or feedback.</p>"
