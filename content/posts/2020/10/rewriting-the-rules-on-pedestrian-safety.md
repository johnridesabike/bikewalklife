Previously on Bike Walk Life, we took a look at the glaring shortcomings of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s “Pedestrian Safety Month” campaign. I use scare-quotes because the campaign was seemingly premised on the idea that pedestrians are to blame for their own deaths. We’re at a point in history where pedestrian deaths are rising, and it’s not because the people on foot are becoming more dangerous, it’s because of our cars and streets.

[AmericaWalks recently took it upon themselves to create some alternative pedestrian safety graphics](https://americawalks.org/we-asked-nhtsa-to-rewrite-the-pedestrian-safety-playbook/):

> The truth is that we know what it takes to save lives and blaming pedestrians isn’t it. We’re going to [keep pushing USDOT](https://americawalks.org/the-federal-government-can-spur-dramatic-transformation-for-pedestrian-safety-if-it-so-chooses/) and NHTSA to use their authority to make it safe for those walking and moving on our streets. It’s time for a new pedestrian playbook with real action, not victim blaming.
