US Bike Route 1, which extends from Florida to Maine, is now officially part of costal Georgia. [Jill Nagel for GADOT’s Milepost magazine reports](https://cdn.flipsnack.com/widget/v2/widget.html?hash=tcl6pct4ot&p=31):

> “When we approach roadway design, Georgia DOT’s Complete Streets Design Policy makes accommodations for bicycle, pedestrian and transit vehicles that we routinely incorporate into our transportation projects as a means for improving mobility, access and safety for the traveling public,” said Troy Pittman, Southeast Region preconstruction engineer. “Official designation of a U.S. or Georgia bicycle route further ensures that current and future projects along the route will be studied and developed for potential implementation of bicycle accommodations,” noted Pittman.

You can view the entire route, and others like it, on the [Adventure Cycling Network Map](https://www.adventurecycling.org/routes-and-maps/adventure-cycling-route-network/interactive-network-map/).

It’s wonderful to see projects like this come to fruition. Costal Georgia, with its beautiful countryside, is a great location for this route. I’m looking forward to seeing stories about people making use of it.
