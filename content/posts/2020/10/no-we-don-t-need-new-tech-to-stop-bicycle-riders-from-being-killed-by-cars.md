It’s no secret that our cities and towns are dangerous for people on bicycles. Most public discussion of that topic avoids the elephant in the room, that car culture is the direct cause of the danger. The way we build our cars, the way we design our streets, and the way we enforce our laws is all enabling cars to kill people. Unless we can make cars smaller, slower, and in fewer numbers, then peace just isn’t possible.

But that doesn’t stop people from trying to find a magic solution where death-by-car is eradicated but also car culture is free to dominate our towns. [John R. Quain, writing for the New York Times, has a puff piece about one such technology: bicycle-to-vehicle devices](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/09/business/bicycle-safety-cars.html):

> The LINKS Foundation, a tech company, had outfitted the demo bicycle with a global navigation device to determine its precise location and a 5G transceiver to convey that information to nearby vehicles. The concept envisions a future where everything — literally the internet of things — is online to create smart roads and smart cities. Traffic lights will see cars coming, cars will see pedestrians at intersections, and bicycles will talk to cars.

He goes on to describe how this technology is being tested on bicycle computers. Bicycles use it to “talk” to the cars around them, so the cars can warn the drivers or, if autonomous, react themselves. 

We should always be open to new ideas that can save lives, but this gives me a queazy feeling. Even if the proposed system works (it doesn’t yet), then it’s still founded on a broken assumption that car culture is blameless, that drivers and car manufacturers aren’t responsible for the deaths they cause, and that people on _bicycles_ are to blame for their own deaths. Even if Quain doesn’t argue this directly, it’s the worldview that his article encourages.

Or perhaps a shorter critique is: it’s ridiculous for us to expect people on bicycles to buy brand new devices or apps for the privilege of not getting killed by cars. It’s more ridiculous than the idea that people are required to wear high-visibility clothing if they don’t want to get killed. 

Most people on foot or on bicycles who die in traffic crashes are elderly, low-income, homeless, or all of the above. Inventing a new gizmo to sell at bike shops isn’t going to save their lives. If anything, it could devalue their lives even _more_, since drivers may be less motivated to avoid killing people who their cars can’t “see.”

Although bicycle-to-vehicle technology is pitched as a lifesaver for people on bicycles, the real beneficiary would be the car industry. It would serve as a way for them to avoid responsibility for building vehicles that are deadly-by-design.

The good news is that we don’t have to wait until the future when a magic technology stops people from dying. We can act now to make our streets safer by fighting car culture.
