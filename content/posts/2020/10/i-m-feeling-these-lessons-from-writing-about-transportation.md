John Bennet, a long-time mobility advocate in Savannah, [published a reflection on his decade of writing about transportation](https://www.connectsavannah.com/savannah/the-news-cycle-is-complete/Content?oid=15254469). The lessons he notes are partially about writing and advocacy, and partially about the causes themselves. For example, he notes that he faced a lot of criticism from people who see bicycles as a special interest, one that's misaligned with the public good, and how that is untrue:

> Over the years I’ve received emails and letters accusing me of being a lobbyist for a special interest group and that I care only about people who ride bikes.
>
> The truth is when a street is made safer for people who ride bikes, it becomes safer for everyone who uses it, including people who walk, people who take the bus, people who ride scooters and skateboards, and people who use wheelchairs and other assistive devices. And people who drive.

As a blogger who writes about bicycle and pedestrian transportation issues, I found I have a lot in common with his philosophy. These lines in particular stood out to me:

> I’m sometimes asked if it is difficult to find fresh angles on a fairly narrow topic, column after column. The truth is it’s not a narrow topic at all, again, as my editor astutely predicted.
>
> Still, I’ve read back through the archives and I will admit I’ve repeated myself more often than I would like. On the flipside I am able to detect persistent themes that remain relevant.

When I began Bike Walk Life, I had a general idea of what I wanted this blog to look like. I knew it was going to be a narrow topic, and I planned on repeating persistent themes. Since this is an internet blog, not a syndicated column, I have the freedom to repeat myself over and over. I believe that this kind of repetition is not only acceptable, but ideal. It hones the arguments and keeps them adaptive to changing climates and topics. Certain themes, like the dignity of people on foot, are timeless and deserve constant repetition.
