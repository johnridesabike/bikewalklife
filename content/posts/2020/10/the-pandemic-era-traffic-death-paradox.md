One of this blog’s refrains is that we need to lower the number of cars on our streets in order to stop people from dying in crashes. Cars are inherently dangerous and, as they get larger and faster, they grow more deadly every year. However, our “new abnormal” has presented a paradox: Americans drove far less this year, but traffic deaths went up. How is that possible? Of course, true paradoxes don’t exist, only _apparent_ paradoxes. [Alissa Walker, writing for Curbed, has a report on the topic](https://www.curbed.com/2020/10/covid-traffic-deaths-up-speeding.html): 

> So what was happening? The biggest factor, NHTSA’s report suggests, may be twofold: the type of driver who was still out making trips during the pandemic despite stay-at-home orders and the **driving behavior that the empty streets allowed**.

(Emphasis mine.)

That second point is the one that got my attention. The big picture is that cars and drivers are not the only the only pieces of the equation. The design of our streets plays an enormous role.

Most streets and roads in America are designed so that vehicles can move “safely” as fast as they want. That means we make them wide, straight, and clear everything around them. But driving as fast as you want is inherently dangerous. So our streets, ironically, just end up enabling dangerous behaviors.

It seems like this cycle was kept at an equilibrium for a while thanks to congestion, which forced drivers to slow down and pay attention. When congestion disappeared, drivers were free to live their Mad Max fantasies.

This particular quote from the NHTSA’s report struck me:

> Faster travel, whether or not actually exceeding the speed limit, increases the chance of fatalities in a crash.

In other words, drivers can follow the speed limit, and presumably other laws as well, and still be at a higher risk of killing someone.
