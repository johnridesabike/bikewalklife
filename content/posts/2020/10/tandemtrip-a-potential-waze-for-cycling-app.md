If you ever wished your phone could give you real-time updates about cycling or walking conditions, that’s what [TandemTrip](https://www.tandemtripapp.com) is for.

> **TandemTrip** is a smartphone app that integrates navigation, route condition information, and social connection for people traveling on bike or by foot into a singular platform – focused on trip safety, convenience, and reliability. Our goal is to help you get moving and maintain an active lifestyle by reducing barriers and connecting you with others in your community.TandemTrip partners with local government and organizations to provide two-way communication on trail and bike facility conditions so you’re prepared if barriers are on your route and maintenance crews can respond more quickly to these issues.

The app is currently in the “exploratory” phase, which comes before funding, development, and finally launch. Their website has links to surveys for potential users and partners, though. So if it sounds interesting, you can send them your thoughts.

I’m always glad to see more support for bike riders, so TandemTrip may have a lot of potential. Apps with bicycle directions aren’t new (Google Maps has offered it for years), but they have never been more than serviceable. If you try to use Google Maps to give you bike directions, you’ll quickly learn that the app probably has a different idea of “bikeable” than you do.

My only comment on TandemTrip is about a problem that the app doesn’t mention. When biking, most of the difficulties come not from unexpected traffic or blocks on routes you’re used to taking. The biggest difficulty comes from finding _new_ routes, and it stems from infrastructural problems.

Car-centric apps, like Google Maps, don’t understand all of the routes available to bicycles. Bicycles and pedestrians are free to cut through parking lots, alleys, and empty lots. Near my commute, the bike path runs just a few feet past a small side-street, but doesn’t officially connect. Apps can’t “see” these potential routes. 

On the other hand, existing map apps can pick routes that are unsafe or stressful for all but the most fearless cyclists. A human navigator will  take a detour through a quiet neighborhood rather than bike straight down a high-speed artery, but computers, in their unswerving logic, have a different opinion.

Can an app provide accurate, safe, GPS directions for people on bicycles? I don’t see why not, but the problem is economic rather than technical. Someone needs to do the work to produce the data that can make it happen.
