Bike to Work (or There) Day will be held this Friday, October 9, in Columbus, Georgia. Considering that many of us aren’t commuting to work in this pandemic era, they’ve modified the holiday this year to encourage people to bike “there.” That could be the grocery store, your friends house, or just around your neighborhood.

If you bike commute on that day, you can [help the organizers by recording your participation in this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfIj8QDDetUyzWhZgCJzKwpT7JI-M-FeAfZZLohPqeu4jmwFw/viewform). They will also be at [Iron Bank Coffee](https://ironbankcoffee.com) from 7am to 10am for you to drop by and say hello!
