Our nation's first federal “National Pedestrian Safety Month” seems to be already under criticism. And the complaints are coming from people most supportive of pedestrian safety. [Kea Wilson on Streetsblog USA has an article](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2020/09/30/national-pedestrian-safety-month-campaign-is-an-offensive-parade-of-dangerous-traffic-violence-myths/) that doesn’t mince words on the topic:

> The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \[NHTSA\] [released its plans](https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/national-pedestrian-safety-month-october) for the month-long public awareness effort yesterday, which includes a cache of social media graphics rife with some of the most toxic lies and misperceptions about how to keep walkers safe — and zero mention of real policy and infrastructure reforms that could _actually_ saves lives.

As is sadly unsurprising, the NHTSA continues to spread propaganda for cars. All of the agency’s messages are aimed at blaming pedestrians for their own deaths. It ignores the reality that our streets, and cars are dangerous-by-design, and that cars are constantly killing people. 

Most tiring is the myth of distracted pedestrians. As Wilson notes, only 2 percent of all pedestrian crashes involve a walker with a phone, yet these cases get the most attention. This myth is even more absurd when juxtaposed with the NHTSA’s message about most pedestrian deaths being with people aged between 50 and 64. You know the stereotype of the 64 year old who walks around staring at their phone all day? Me neither. (And what does the NHTSA want people in that age range to do, anyway? Grow younger?)

Agencies like NHTSA could, of course, be working to ensure that pedestrians _don’t_ get killed, regardless of their age or what color clothes they’re wearing. It looks like we still have a lot of work to do before we get to that point, though.
