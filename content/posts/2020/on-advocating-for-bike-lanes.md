Robert Annis, writing for Bicycling:

> While we’d love to see more bike lanes in the U.S, there are many things you’ll want to do make that dream a reality in many communities. Experts Joe Cutrufo, communications director for New York City’s Transportation Alternatives, and Karen Campbell, director of development and communications for BikeWalk K.C. in Kansas City, Missouri, offered their thoughts on how you can gather the information you need, who you need to talk with, and how you can keep that bike lane protected long after it’s put in place.
