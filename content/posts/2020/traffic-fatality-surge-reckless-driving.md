Current events reveal how our roads are dangerous by design:

> New data from the National Safety Council (NSC) found the U.S. traffic fatality rate jumped 23.5% in May, compared to the year prior, despite the number of vehicle miles driven in that month dropping 25.5% amid pandemic-related stay-at-home orders.

> "The pandemic has actually exposed our national road safety culture for what it really is: deeply flawed and unfortunately in need of some immediate action," Martin said. "It’s clear that our open roads have created somewhat of an open season for reckless driving."
