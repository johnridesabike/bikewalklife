I’m always game for an old-fashioned, just-for-fun, bicycle challenge. Sure the Bike League’s big National Bike Challenge and city events like [Atlanta’s Biketober](https://www.lovetoride.net/atlanta?locale=en-US) are great, but there’s something special about the low-stakes, high-fun challenges that are run by ordinary people on the blogosphere and social media.

## [Coffeeneuring](https://chasingmailboxes.com/2020/09/27/coffeeneuring-challenge-2020-one-good-thing/)

This has been one of my favorite annual challenges for a while. The premise is simple: ride a bike to spots where you drink beverages. If you do this enough and take photos of it, you’ll earn fabulous prizes.

From the official rules:

> Essentially the challenge boils down to this:
>
> * over the course of 7’ish weeks,
> * ride your bike to 7 different places,
> * at least 2 miles round trip each time,
> * drink 7 cups of coffee (or similar), and
> * take 7 pictures (or other documentation) as proof of your coffeeneuring.

It begins on Saturday, October 10th. It’s free to participate, although you usually need to cover the cost of your prize if you want one (typically a few dollars).

## [Three Speed October](https://societyofthreespeeds.wordpress.com/2020/09/25/three-speed-october-2020-starts-today/)

This one is new to me, but it looks like fun. It’s managed by the Society of Three Speeds, and its rules are simple:

> From now until Sunday November 1st:
>
> 1. Ride a _three speed bicycle_
> 2. _Three times a week_
> 3. At least _three miles_ (5 km) each trip
> 4. For _at least three weeks_ during the duration of the challenge
> 5. During a five-week period that centers around the month of October

This challenge does have an entry fee ($17 to $22), but that cost covers your materials including an official reporting journal. Swanky.

The challenge has officially started already. Sadly, I do not ride a three-speed bicycle so I cannot qualify.
