Amsterdam-based BYCS has a program called Bicycle Mayors. According to their [network map](https://bycs.org/our-work/bicycle-mayor/#intr1), they have several mayors appointed in cities around the world, and a few in the United States.

The name “bicycle mayor” felt a bit misleading to me at first. The “mayors” are not actual city mayors who happen to ride bicycles. They are private individuals who have volunteered to advocate for bicycling in their cities and to represent their fellow citizens who use bicycles.

But these mayors are more than just lone enthusiasts. My understanding is that BYCS is serious about vetting the credentials and reliability of each mayoral applicant. [Pattie Baker is currently applying to be Bicycle Mayor of Atlanta](https://travelingatthespeedofbike.com/2020/09/23/bicycle-mayor-update/), and she needed several letters of recommendation from leaders. She also outlined her goals and and how she’ll achieve them if she earns the title.

The program looks intriguing to me, and I’m looking forward to seeing how it grows in this country. It appears to have a balanced mix of international networking and local problem-solving.

You can browse the current bicycle mayors on their site to see what they do in their own words. Here’s one example from [Courtney Williams of New York City](https://bycs.org/courtney-williams/): 

> **HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR MISSION?**
>
> On a daily basis I issue public comment, encourage, elevate and facilitate conversations around the racial and economic equity of proposed cycling initiatives.
>
> During the COVID-19 crisis – particularly during Bike Month – my goal is to help keep cyclists’ spirits up by producing virtual social programming that demonstrates it is possible to celebrate their love of cycling in ways that are socially responsible and will continue to help New York “flatten the curve.”
>
> I will advocate that our public transportation agencies fund comprehensive bicycling education for NYC’s adult cyclists for the sake of creating more responsible and empowered cyclists, thereby increasing the chances of sustaining the surge in functional bike ridership that has resulted from COVID-19 crisis.
