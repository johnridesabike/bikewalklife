From ClickOrlando:

> During its Wednesday council, Orlando City Commission approved a new temporary permits, which would allow businesses to expand their outdoor seating by utilizing street parking spaces, known as “parklets.”
>
> “What we want to do is figure out how to give them more space,” Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said. “We’ll have a process which is simply calling one of our planning officials. There’s no fees and we just want to make sure that we set it up in a safe manner.”

Parking takes up a massive amount of space in our cities, but most of us barely notice it. Once you start paying attention though, it’s astounding how much land is consumed by (mostly empty) parking spaces. It’s good to see it this space put to productive use.
