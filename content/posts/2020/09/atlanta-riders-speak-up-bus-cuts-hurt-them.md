David Wickert, writing for AJC, published a few of the comments they received from MARTA riders regarding the current bus cuts. Here’s one example:

> Please start our buses back. We have to get Uber or Lyft to the train station every morning and evening that is costing us a fortune, especially at my age (68) and still working. We need help. somebody save us, please. A lot of people don’t have a car in my neighborhood. Just don’t forget about us. We still ride your trains Praying for help.

It looks like the pandemic has exasperated the inequalities that have already long plagued our transportation system.
