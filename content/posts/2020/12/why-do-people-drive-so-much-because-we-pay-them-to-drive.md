It’s no secret that we subsidize driving to a degree that’s vastly disproportionate to other kinds of transportation. [Joe Cortright has a piece in City Observatory that discusses this problem](https://cityobservatory.org/the-only-reason-some-people-drive-is-because-we-pay-them-to/).

> Freeways are only “free” in the sense that, no matter when you drive, you pay the same marginal price: Nothing. Of course, we all pay for roads through things like the gas tax and vehicle registration fees (as well as a host of other general taxes), but the point is, whether you use a road at the peak hour or not has no effect on how **much** you pay to drive. Whether you use it at 2 am when there are literally no other cars on the road, or you use it when it’s jammed at rush hour, makes no difference. And because peak hour capacity is in short supply, and is damned expensive to increase, “free” roads are a massive subsidy from the general public to the relatively few of us who use roads at the peak.

> When we ask road users to pay even a modest fraction of the cost of providing that expensive peak hour road capacity, many of them tell us, by voting with their feet (or their tires), that they simply don’t value the roadway enough to pay for even a tiny fraction of its cost.

This isn’t a new issue, but Cortright reveals an aspect of it that’s new to me. There’s only a small threshold between congested and free-flowing traffic: 

> One of the fascinating, and least widely understood aspects of the science of traffic jams is that it takes only a small reduction in traffic levels to keep roads flowing freely. As long as traffic levels stay below a tipping point where the road becomes saturated and loses capacity, the road works well. Adding (or subtracting) just a few cars when traffic is at this tipping point makes a huge difference both in travel times and how many cars a road can carry.

A common argument for why we need to keep paying for car infrastructure it that people need it. This is a true statement, albeit an unfortunate reality. The problem with this argument is that we’re also subsidizing the infrastructure for people who _only_ use it because it’s “free” for them to use it. This is one reason why adding lanes rarely reduces congestion. Drivers  quickly move to fill up their new “free” space.

But this data on traffic tipping points provides an insight into the solution. We don’t need a drastic reduction of traffic to fix congestion, only a slight one. Lowering driving subsidies is one straightforward way of achieving that reduction.
