I’ve been a bike enthusiast for several years. I ride my bicycle to and from work most days, even though I live in one of the most car-dominated regions in the world. Riding bicycles can feel liberating sometimes, but living car-free (or car-lite) is not always easy.

The name _Bike Walk Life_ comes from my belief that an ideal life puts walking and biking at the foundation of the transportation "food pyramid." When that pyramid gets inverted, as it does in a car-centric society, then it comes at the cost of happiness, health, and human life itself.

I hope you enjoy this blog. Please feel free to fill out the [contact form](https://bikewalk.life/contact/) if you have any comments or feedback.
