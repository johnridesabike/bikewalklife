Georgia Bikes just shared their advocacy priorities for the next three years. And a bill for one of them, the "yield bill," is already moving forward in the state house.

The bill HB978 would "authorize operators of bicycles to treat stop signs as yield signs" if passed. It was approved by the House Motor Vehicles Committee on February 6, thus clearing one of many hurdles it faces to eventually become law.

It's great to have a statewide organization that not only advocates for bicycling but is transparent about its long-term plans. This helps set a model for local organizations, like my own city's, to follow.

[You can view the priorities in graphic form on their website here](https://georgiabikes.org/georgia-bikes-policy-priorities/), but I've recreated the text below for better accessibility. All credit for its contents goes to Georgia Bikes.
## State priorities

### 1. Vulnerable road user legislation

Protect VRUs with increased penalties for drivers who injure or kill a pedestrian, bicyclist, wheelchair user, or worker in the roadway.

### 2. Georgia yield legislation

Pass Georgia Yield legislation, allowing bicyclists to proceed through a stop sign without coming to a full stop when it is safe to do so.

### 3. Enforcement of three-foot law

Ensure effective enforcement of the three-foot passing law, fostering a culture of safety and adherence.

### 4. Safe speeds on Georgia roads

- ﻿﻿Simplify the process for local jurisdictions to lower speed limits.
- ﻿﻿Update the state's "85th-percentile" rule for speed-limit setting

## Local priorities

### 1. Complete streets approach

Increase number of communities implementing a complete streets approach (ex.: complete streets policy, vision zero plan, local bike/ped coordinator, traffic-calming program, etc.).

### 2. Planning & development patterns

Increase community walkability and bikeability through the use of comprehensive plans, zoning codes, metropolitan transportation plans, and other local and regional mechanisms.

### 3. Infrastructure funding

Work with cities and counties to dedicate local dollars and pursue federal and state match funding to build better bike/walk infrastructure.
