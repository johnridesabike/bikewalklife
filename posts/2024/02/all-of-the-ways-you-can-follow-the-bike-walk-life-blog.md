Now that I'm back to writing for this blog, here's how you can stay up-to-date with each new post.

## Option 1: Web feed

The most basic and reliable way is to subscribe to this website's feed. Just point your favorite feed reader app to this website and you should be good to go. If you need to configure your reader manually, the feed's direct URL is here: `https://bikewalk.life/feed.xml`

I think web feeds are a great bit of technology, even if they never quite hit the mainstream. [Here is a quick primer for how feeds work](https://aboutfeeds.com/).

## Option 2: Email newsletter

If you aren't using a feed reader app, then [you can subscribe to my email newsletter version here](https://mailchi.mp/8215c6ef46cd/bike-walk-life-digest). This newsletter is set up to automatically take the feed's content and aggregate it into a weekly summary. The key difference between this and option 1 is that it only updates once a week. We all have too much in our inboxes already, so I consider that to be a feature.

## Option 3: Social media (to an extent)

I have a couple of social media accounts I use in conjunction with this blog. They sort of mirror the feed too, except I haven't gotten around to automating them.

My official accounts are:

- [Bluesky: @bikewalk.life](https://bsky.app/profile/bikewalk.life)
- [Mastodon: @bikewalklife@indieweb.social](https://indieweb.social/@bikewalklife)

Why only those and not whatever-other-social-media-app instead? The technical answer is that the [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/) service works with those.

The longer answer is that they allow me to take any "likes," "reposts," etc. and display those on each page of this blog. You can see the bottom of my recent "[I'm back](https://bikewalk.life/2024/02/i-m-back/)" post for an example of how "likes" display.

## Use whatever works for you

Just like bicycles, I like to keep my digital technology simple and elegant. Back when the word "blog" first appeared, in the olden days of the early 2000s, people followed them by just checking bookmarks regularly. If that still works for you, go for it.

Personally, I get exhausted by keeping up with the revolving door of new apps and services, since the good ol' web still works fine for me. I hope that the options I provide here can empower you to keep reading however you enjoy.
