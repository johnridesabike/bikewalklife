People Powered Movement, an organization that focuses on improving bicycle advocacy across the United States, just published a bicycle safety overview of Columbus Georgia. They summarize the state of our infrastructure, crash data, and the city's progress so far.

[You can read their report here](https://www.peoplepoweredmovement.org/bicycle-safety-overview-in-columbus-ga-infrastructure-and-crash-stats/). It's a birds-eye view of all of the available public data. So while it does not make any new insights that Columbus residents probably haven't seen before, it neatly organizes the information into one page. 
 
Hopefully reports like this will help the city's name get more traction with the larger bicycling culture, at least among anyone who follows this kind of reporting or who searches the web for them.
