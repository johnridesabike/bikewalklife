It's been a couple of months since I blogged here. Being busy making bicycle events happen left me with hardly any time to write about other bike news. Here's a quick update with the stuff I've done since my last post.

May was Bike Month, and Bike Month is big in Columbus Georgia. We at Bicycle Columbus hosted our Ride With the Mayor, Bike-to-work day, and the Ride of Silence tribute. We also got our mayor Skip Henderson to officially proclaim May as Bike Month for the first time in Columbus.

[You can watch my interview with WRBL about bike-to-work day and other events that month here](https://www.wrbl.com/news/local-news/bicycle-columbus-encourages-locals-to-bike-to-work-hosts-coffee-meetup/).

But as soon as Bike Month was over, June was still packed with more bicycle events. We hosted our annual Juneteenth Black History bicycle tour and the cycling portion of the Georgia Police and Fire Games. We also helped cut the ribbon for our city's latest park-and-ride.

[You can watch my interview with WTVM about the Juneteenth ride here](https://www.wtvm.com/2024/06/18/fountain-city-gears-up-juneteenth-celebrations/).

[You can read about the park-and-ride here](https://www.wrbl.com/news/metra-host-linwood-park-and-ride-grand-opening/), and [you can watch the full video of the ribbon-cutting ceremony here](https://youtu.be/WnTJ-STVajA?si=CbjWJvrvbbtEtErF) (I take the stage at 11:20).

That's all for now. It's been an exhausting summer so far, and I look forward to when I'll be able to get back to blogging again.
