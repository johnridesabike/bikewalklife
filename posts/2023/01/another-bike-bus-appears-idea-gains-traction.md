Last year, a PE teacher in Portland made national headlines with his "bike bus." The idea was to replace the regular school buses (or car drop-offs) with bicycles. Each morning, he leads a parade of children on bikes through his neighborhood to school. Now one of WIRED's editors has gotten her own bike bus off the ground.

The author, Adrienne So, discusses the importance of getting kids biking in general, but also how meaningful the bike bus specifically can be to residents. One quote: "...it’s empowering to see children take control of their lives in a way that we simply haven’t seen since the start of the pandemic. It’s probably why people get emotional when they see it." She also outlines advice for other parents interested in starting their own.
