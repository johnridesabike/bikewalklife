In 2022, cycles were the largest category of daytime traffic in London, according to the City of London Corporation's transportation committee. They have been increasing since 1999, while personal vehicle use has decreased.

In the broader context, bicycles do not create a majority of traffic, nor do they outnumber other vehicles overall. London hosts a diverse mixture of vehicles, including bicycles, motorcycles, busses, vans, taxis, and personal cars. Of those categories, bicycles are now the largest. Walking, without a vehicle, is still the primary way most people travel.
