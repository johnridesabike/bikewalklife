The Philadelphia Inquirer has published a story about the importance of bicycling for low-income people. Sarahi Franco-Morales, the author, describes how her whole family depends on bicycles to go about their daily lives.

[You can read the story here: "For my low-income family, biking is not recreation. ‘It’s survival.’"](https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/biking-philadelphia-university-of-pennsylvania-20230202.html) ([Archived link without a paywall](https://archive.is/jjCFX).)

> After all, if it were not for my bike, I would have no way of delivering on the big promises I made to my community, and I would have never been admitted last month to the University of Pennsylvania.
> \[...\]
> But even though all three of us are bike enthusiasts, biking is not recreation for us. It’s survival.

I have written before about how low-income bicycle riders are usually "invisible" to the rest of the world, [which you can read here](https://bikewalk.life/2021/02/invisible-riders-and-the-ignored-diversity-of-bicycle-users). Very little of our transportation infrastructure caters to riders like them (even our bike infrastructure), but once you spend time in public, either on a bicycle or on foot, you start noticing these once-invisible riders everywhere.

Stories like Franco-Morales' are a great way to bring visibility to this often-ignored segment of our population, and to call attention to the importance of safe biking and walking infrastructure for everyone.
