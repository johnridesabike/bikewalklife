The PeopleForBikes 2022 City Ratings are here. Every year, the organization PeopleForBikes aggregates data and collects stories to rate how bikeable cities across the world are.

[You can check out how your city ranks and how you can help improve it for next year here](https://cityratings.peopleforbikes.org/).

This kind of data can provide insight into what your community can improve and what it's doing well already. I don't particularly find the overall rating useful (I don't like how it's framed as a competition), but the details and stories behind it can be.

For example, Columbus Georgia has a very low score for some factors like access to retail, but a very high score for others like how much ridership we have. This isn't surprising to me as a resident, but now I have data to back up what was originally just my impression.

Whether good or bad, these numbers can be a starting point for a conversation on what your community can do next.
