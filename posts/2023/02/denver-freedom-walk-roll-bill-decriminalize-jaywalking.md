Denver, Colorado has just become the latest area to decriminalize jaywalking. The city council recently passed the "Freedom to Walk and Roll" bill, although crossing outside of an intersection still remains illegal under Colorado state law.

Bills like this are only one step to making our public spaces safe for everyone. Most people cross outside of intersections because they have no choice--there either isn't a crossing or there are no safe sidewalks. But even as those issues remain, decriminalization of walking means one less problem for pedestrians to worry about.
