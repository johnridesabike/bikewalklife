The Sheldon Brown website apparently offers a new AI service. Fed up with ChatGPT giving them wrong information about bicycles, they have decided to start a business reviewing its machine-generated output.

> Like it or not, human-AI partnership is key to a livable future. As of April 1, 2023, ShelBroCo is revising our business model to include review of AI-generated articles and imagery.

## In other news: bicycles appear in Strut the Hooch

Also falling on April first, Columbus Georgia had its annual [Strut the Hooch](https://strutthehooch.com/) parade for all things "weird, wacky, and wild." It's an excuse for people to dress up and have fun. It has costumes, bands, and general silliness.

(For non-locals, the "Hooch" refers to the Chattahoochee river, which is a block away from where the parade takes place.)

This year, I and a few other people represented Bicycle Columbus. We dressed up and biked along with the parade. It was a lot of fun! One of our riders even won a trophy for her costume. I hope we can continue organizing this for upcoming years.
