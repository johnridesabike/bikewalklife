In 2023, Columbus was renewed as a bronze-level Bicycle Friendly Community (BFC) by The League of American Bicyclists. Local media station WRBL picked up the story this week.

[You can read the WRBL report here](https://www.wrbl.com/news/local-news/cycling-city-columbus-renews-bronze-level-bike-friendly-community-status/).

The article has quotes from Bicycle Columbus and Piedmont Columbus Regional Healthcare. They discuss why the BCF award is important as well as the improvements we need to continue working on. I think they all did a great job at covering the topic.
