For you bicycle and coffee lovers, we're getting two events back-to-back this year. International Coffee Outside Day is happening on Sunday, October first, and the Coffeeneuring Challenge kicks off one week later, on October seventh.

[International Coffee Day is organized by the company RideWithGPS](https://coffeeoutside.ridewithgps.com/). You can join or host an official meetup for cyclists to drink coffee together, and it has sponsors and prizes. You can learn more about it on their official website [RWGPSCoffeeOutside.com](https://rwgpscoffeeoutside.com).

Coffeeneuring is a non-corporate challenge that runs from October 7 through November 20. Participants will each go on seven bike rides to drink coffee (or another fall-type beverage). It has a list of official rules, but the spirit of the challenge is laid back and fun. For the most part, as long as you ride a bike and drink a hot beverage, then you qualify. [You can read all of the details on the Chasing Mailboxes blog](https://chasingmailboxes.com/2023/09/24/coffeeneuring-challenge-2023-lucky-13/). 

I've participated in Coffeeneuring for several years now, some of which I documented on this blog:

- [My Coffeeneuring results for 2022](https://bikewalk.life/2022/11/my-2022-coffeeneuring-challenge-results/).
- [My Coffeeneuring results for 2021](https://bikewalk.life/2021/11/biking-for-coffee-coffeeneuring-2021-summary/).
- [My Coffeeneuring results for 2020](https://bikewalk.life/2021/01/looking-back-at-my-2020-coffeeneuring/).

I'm looking forward to joining again for 2023!
