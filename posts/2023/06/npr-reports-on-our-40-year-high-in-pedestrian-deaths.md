A few months ago, [we saw that pedestrian fatalities in the U.S. have reached a 40-year high](https://bikewalk.life/2023/04/new-nhtsa-report-shows-pedestrian-and-bicycle-fatalities-hit-a-40-year-high/). Now the news is hitting mainstream outlets like NPR, who also have some ideas to fix it.

[You can read NPR's report here](https://www.npr.org/2023/06/26/1184034017/us-pedestrian-deaths-high-traffic-car).

Their analysis of the issue is overall pretty good this time. They interview experts who cite fundamental issues with our car-centric infrastructure, and they also list realistic ways we can improve the problem immediately, such as traffic-calming measures that lower speed limits. This is a welcome improvement from the [last time NPR reported on rising traffic deaths, where they entirely blamed it on poor policing](https://bikewalk.life/2023/04/npr-reports-on-america-s-deadly-roads-but-blames-under-policing-instead-of-street-design/).

I noticed one odd detail, though. While discussing how the Sun-Belt states have the highest rate of deaths, they list several theories why, including some seemingly-superficial ones like "Southern states have better weather and people spend more time outside." They don't mention one obvious pattern, which I said last time I wrote about this: "[Those are the regions that saw most of their growth happen after the 1960s, when the government aggressively poured money into high-speed highways and sprawling suburban developments. That transportation design is highly dangerous, and it now dominates the Sun Belt](https://bikewalk.life/2022/07/dangerous-by-design-2022-traffic-deaths-are-getting-worse-especially-in-the-sun-belt/)".

But if there really is a connection between better weather and higher pedestrian activity, and therefore higher pedestrian deaths, then that's all the more reason why we need to invest in safer infrastructure.
