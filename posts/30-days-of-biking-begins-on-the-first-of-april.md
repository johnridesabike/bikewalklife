One week from today, the 30 Days of Biking challenge will begin on April 1st and run through the end of the month. The challenge is simple: ride a bicycle every day for 30 days. And there’s no pressure, since pretty much anything counts as a ride.

> 30 Days of Biking is a pledge to ride your bike every day in April and share your adventures online with the hashtag #30daysofbiking.
> 
> There’s no minimum distance — down a hill and around your garage count just like a 20-mile commute or a 350-mile charity ride.⁣⁣
> 
> ⁣If you miss a day, no worries. Just keep riding and don’t give up! It's all for fun, or as serious as you want it to be. What matters is we’re all in this together.⁣⁣⁣⁣

With National Bike Month, May, coming up afterwards, it looks like we’ll have plenty of excuses to ride bicycles for a while.
