The Dragonfly Trails in Columbus, Georgia is on track to grow next year. The upcoming project will add new multi-use trails that people can use use for recreation and active transportation as well as improve crosswalks and parking for the Midtown area.

The [Ledger-Enquirer has a report about it][0].

> Dinglewood Park Trail is the first step in creating an east-west connection through midtown, Dragonfly Trails executive director Becca Zajac told the Ledger-Enquirer in an email. It will run through one of Columbus’ most active residential areas, she said, including Lakebottom Park, the Columbus Museum and Columbus High School.
> .
> “For years, residents have asked for safer ways to reach these parks, schools and nearby businesses without navigating busy streets,” Zajac said.

Besides connecting people to existing parks and businesses, this new trail segment will also connect to the [upcoming children's bicycle playground][1]. The Dragonfly Trails have been a fantastic asset to the city over the years, so it's great to see that they're still improving and expanding.
