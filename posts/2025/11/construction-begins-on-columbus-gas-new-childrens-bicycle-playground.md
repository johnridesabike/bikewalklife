This past Wednesday was Groundbreaking Day for the MidTown Children's Bicycle Playground. Once complete, it will feature trails, bridges, and pump tracks designed for children and teenagers to learn the basics of mountain biking. [You can read more in the Ledger-Enquirer's report][1]:

> "The MidTown Children's Bicycle Playground will encourage children to exercise, learn basic biking skills, and take those learned skills with them to Standing Boy and the Dragonfly Trails, all while enjoying outdoor activities and quality time away from their screens," the news release says. "It will draw diverse families to the area and clearly serve as an enhanced amenity to MidTown." 

They plan to have it open by January. There are also plans to extend the Dragonfly Trails, Columbus' multi-use path network, to connect directly to the new park, which will help strengthen that network for everyone who uses it for recreation and transportation.
