I had the privilege of attending and presenting at [Go Georgia's Bike Walk Live Summit](https://www.go-georgia.org/summit) last week (no relation with this blog, Bike Walk *Life*). I joined a panel about bicycle outreach in southwest Georgia. We discussed what Bicycle Columbus does and compared it with our neighbor organization, Sumter Cycling.

This was my first bike summit, and it was a great experience. It felt refreshing and reassuring to meet professionals who understand the state of transportation in Georgia today as well as talk honestly about how much more work we need to do.

As an aside, regular readers may have noticed that this is my first update on this blog in a little over a year. Writing has taken a backseat to my other priorities in life lately, but I'm hoping to start again soon. Even when the updates here are few, be assured that life is going well over here.
