Atlanta, Georgia is planning some big upgrades for its bicycling infrastructure for the upcoming year. [Atlanta Magazine has a summary of what's happening](https://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/where-are-we-pedaling-next-the-new-bicycling-projects-coming-soon-to-metro-altanta/).

Changes are coming on multiple fronts: bike lanes within the city of Atlanta, trail extensions through the PATH Foundation, and mountain biking trails in several parks. There should be something for everybody included.

Improving bicycle infrastructure is always good news, but this is an especially critical moment. With the lockdown-era "bike boom" upon us, public demand for bicycle accessibility is high. [The Cities Down South podcast recently compared our current moment to the 1970s bike boom](https://bikewalk.life/2021/03/new-podcast-cities-down-south-discusses-bicycle-advocacy-in-georgia/), and they argue that the 70s movement was ultimately smothered by a lack of infrastructure investment. Now is our chance to improve from the mistakes of our past.
