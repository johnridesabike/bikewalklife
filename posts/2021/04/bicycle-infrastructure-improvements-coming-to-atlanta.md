Atlanta, Georgia is planning some big upgrades for its bicycling infrastructure for the upcoming year, and [Atlanta Magazine has a summary of what to expect](https://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/where-are-we-pedaling-next-the-new-bicycling-projects-coming-soon-to-metro-altanta/).

Changes are coming on several different fronts: bike lanes within the city of Atlanta, trail extensions through the PATH Foundation, and mountain biking trails in several parks. 

Improving bicycle infrastructure is always good news, but now is an especially critical moment for us. With the lockdown-era "bike boom" upon us, public demand for bicycle accessibility is high. The recent Cities Down South podcast discussed comparisons to our current moment and 70s bike boom, and they argued that the 70s movement was smothered by a lack of infrastructure investment. Now is the chance to improve from the mistakes of our past.
