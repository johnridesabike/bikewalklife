May is Bike Month, and this year we're kicking it off with an inaugural Ride a Bike Day.

[The League of American Bicyclists has the details here](https://bikeleague.org/content/take-part-first-ever-national-ride-bike-day).

> Celebrating **National Ride A Bike Day** is simple: go for a ride -- any ride. Whether it’s a short trip on a bikeshare bike or a double century, any way you choose to ride a bike is the right way to ride a bike.
>
> We hope you’ll join us on **Sunday, May 2**, for National Ride A Bike Day and then keep the celebration of biking going throughout Bike Month in May.

I never oppose an excuse to riding a bicycle. Between this Ride a Bike Day, the finale of [30 Days of Biking in April](https://bikewalk.life/2021/03/30-days-of-biking-begins-on-the-first-of-april/), and a whole calendar of bicycle activities through the rest of May, we have plenty of national events and holidays to choose from.
