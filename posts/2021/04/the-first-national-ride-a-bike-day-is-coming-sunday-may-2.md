May is bike month, and this year it gets kicked off with an inaugural Ride a Bike Day.

[The League of American Bicyclists has the details here](https://bikeleague.org/content/take-part-first-ever-national-ride-bike-day).

> Celebrating **National Ride A Bike Day** is simple: go for a ride -- any ride. Whether it’s a short trip on a bikeshare bike or a double century, any way you choose to ride a bike is the right way to ride a bike.
>
> We hope you’ll join us on **Sunday, May 2**, for National Ride A Bike Day and then keep the celebration of biking going throughout Bike Month in May.

I'm never opposed to excuses for riding a bicycle. Between Ride a Bike Day, 30 Days of Biking in April, and a whole calendar of bicycle activities through the rest of May, we have plenty of national events and holidays to choose from.
