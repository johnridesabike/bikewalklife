We tend to think of daily transportation, especially commuting, as time wasted. The more time we spend going to or from work is time that could have been spent on something more economic and useful. A recent paper is using a concept called _flow theory_ to challenge this notion.

You can read the paper here: [Have a good trip! Expanding our concepts of the quality of everyday travelling with flow theory](https://doi.org/10.1080/23800127.2021.1912947).

> ...being ‘on the move’ is a rich experience interlaced with profound shared and individual meanings that can have positive implications on quality of life, well-being and personal development. Yet, mobility in general, and commuting in particular, is often reported as one of the least pleasant daily experiences and as a source of massive environmental impacts.

[Flow theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) is something we all know even if we don't know its name. It occurs when we focus our attention on an activity we enjoy. It happens when we make art, sing, dance, write, play games, or anything else that can get us "in the zone."

If you don't experience that feeling when you commute, you're not alone. As the paper notes, most people rate commuting as one of their least enjoyable activities. However, that's not always the case. When the COVID-19 lockdowns happened, many people realized they missed their commutes. [CycleCommute.cc blogged last year about "COVID commuting,"](https://cyclecommute.cc/blog/2020/09/06/covid-commuting/) which was just riding a bicycle as a way to get out of the house. In their words, it was a "time to clear my head and de-stress."

In a way, our institutional biases around everyday transportation have become self-fulfilling prophesies. Since we assume commuting is just something we do between more important things, we've turned our streets into dreary corridors of noise and car traffic. 

Although it's possible to experience "flow" while driving, it's far more common in bicycle riders and walkers. The paper mentions specific factors that lead to more enjoyment, including physical activity and interacting with other people (especially with eye contact).

Here's one graph from the article, showing how different activities intersect with a spectrum of mental states:

![A chart of different mental states for cycling, public transport, and car driving.](https://res.cloudinary.com/bike-walk-life/image/upload/t_md_body_retina/f_auto,q_auto/v1619734019/2021/rapm_a_1912947_f0002_b_bb13xb.jpg)

This doesn't mean any one mode is superior, but I can't help but notice that riding a bicycle falls squarely in the upper-right corner, with _flow_ in its center.

But it's also possible to have a negative experience riding a bicycle, especially in areas heavy with cars. In my post, The three kinds of bicycle commuting, I mention how our infrastructure tries to make us ride bicycles as if we're driving a car. That's a sure way to swing our mental state to the other side of the chart, in the _worry_ and _anxiety_ zone.
