Sidewalks, bike lanes, and public transport aren't just modern fads. For most of history, our streets hosted a diverse mixture of mobility methods. What if we could see exactly what our streets would look like without cars dominating them? Thanks to historical archives, we can!

Last year, [we saw the 1906 "A Trip Down Market Street" video restored in 4K](https://bikewalk.life/2020/09/time-travel-to-a-city-street-in-1906/). One of the stunning things about this video is how radically different a city street looked during that time period. To quote [Arian Horbovetz's analysis](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2020/8/28/when-streets-were-for-everyone):

> Trolleys, carriages, bikes, cars and pedestrians—count the number of different forms of mobility in this video. The streets were truly for everyone, regardless of speed, size, or socioeconomic status.

This got me thinking: what if we could gather similar images from the rest of our cities? So I began searching through the [Digital Library of Georgia](https://dlg.usg.edu/) for photos from my current town, Columbus. The results weren't overwhelming, but I did find one particularly revealing photo:

According to the metadata, this was taken between 1895 and 1900. It depicts the Springer Opera House in downtown Columbus, which is still standing and functioning today.

But although the photographer may have been intent on capturing the Springer, I'm more interested in the streets around it. Just like in the Market Street video, we can see people on foot, horses, trolleys and even a bicycle. The still photo can't show us their speeds directly, but we can still see that they're all moving at about the same speed. It's far safer, and slower, than the current car-dominated version of the same street.

Most notably, it's only used by cars. It is now too dangerous, and even illegal, for people with other most other mobility methods to use the street now.

The point here is not to idolize the past, but to recognize how our current "complete streets" ideals are not just modern inventions. Before we re-engineered society to revolve around cars, all of our streets were "complete" in the sense that they accommodated any mode of transportation. This isn't just classic or traditional, it's timeless. By making these historical streets more visible to the public, we can also help challenge the misconception that car-dominance is acceptable.
