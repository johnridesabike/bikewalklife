The trail system in Columbus, GA has seen major upgrades over the past several years. Soon, it will receive another expansion.

[Chuck Williams and Tom Ingram have a report on it for WRBL](https://www.wrbl.com/news/local-news/2-million-project-connects-columbus-dragonfly-trail-with-mlk-jr-trail-upgrades-riverwalk-ramps/):

> ... The work includes reconstruction of existing ramps to the Riverwalk to provide for better pedestrian and cyclist access; curb and gutter; landscaping; signage; and striping.
>
> Rebecca Zajac, executive director of the Dragonfly Trail Network, says the work will improve safety and accessibility.
>
> “The people who are regularly using the Martin Luther King Jr. Trail will have access to the Riverwalk and the Fall Line Trace in a way that’s safe and easily accessible and has lighting,” Zajac said.

I've written about the trails in Columbus previously, and I'm also one of their regular users. Although their use for fitness and recreation gets the spotlight, they're very useful for mobility as well. The newest extensions provide connections to different parts of town, are lit and shaded, and are well-maintained. For commuters, they're fantastic. I'm excited about this upgrade.
