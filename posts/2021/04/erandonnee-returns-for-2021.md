Errandonnee is an annual challenge for running errands by bike or on foot. After a pandemic-induced hiatus last year, it's back for 2021.

[**Read the announcement and rules here**](https://chasingmailboxes.com/2021/04/11/errandonnee-2021-hyperlocal-edition/).

> **_Errandonnee: Complete 12 errands in 12 consecutive days, and ride, run, and/or walk a total of 30 miles. This year, you pick the 12-day stretch that works for you. Must be between April 15 and June 30._**
>
> The term “errandonnee” is a hybrid of “errands” and the French word “[randonnee](http://www.rusa.org/glossary.html).” String 12 errands into one long ride (or run, or walk) interrupted by sleep and other diversions, and you have an Errandonnee. It’s that simple!
>
> You are not limited to riding a bicycle. You can run, walk, or ride your way to the Errandonnee finish line – or any combination of the three.

Since we're still recovering from the pandemic, they've adjusted the rules to provide a more liberal definition of _errand_ for people who may not be going out in public much anymore. New categories include "history lesson" and "helping hand," for example.

It still has my favorite category, though: "You carried WHAT?!"

Errandonnee is more formal compared to its sister challenge, [Coffeeneuring](https://bikewalk.life/2020/09/upcoming-just-for-fun-bicycle-challenges-coffeeneuring-and-three-speed-october/), but it's still primarily about getting outside and having fun. You're given a lot of freedom within the rules, and creativity is encouraged. I'm looking forward to seeing what our fellow Errandonneers come up with!

A bit of personal trivia: I completed Errandonnee for the first time in 2017, and I was the first finisher ever from Georgia. I still have the patch I earned from it.
