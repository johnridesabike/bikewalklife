> "I participated to overcome the obstacles in Mosul, the idea that girls cannot go around freely. I want to break this barrier and show that a girl can be free, that she can go and wear whatever she wants. And that when a girl rides a bicycle, no one should criticize her, by saying it is inappropriate because she is a girl. Our society is complicated, girls are not given their full freedom, everything is for the boys."

> Each participant received a training bike as a gift

The story is reminiscent of the [Afghanistan women's cycling that was covered a few years ago](https://www.bicycling.com/news/a20266673/afghan-cycles-documentary-premieres/).
