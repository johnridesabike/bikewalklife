Illegal courtesies are when car drivers will try to do something courteous to bike riders, such as stop or yield, but in doing so they are actually behaving illegally and dangerously.

[BikeAthens](https://www.bikeathens.org/) has a short (under one minute) video on how to deal with illegal courtesies:

Anecdotally, I've seen a rise in illegal courtesies in my own city as we built more bicycle infrastructure. Sometimes it feels like a "good" problem to have. After all, wouldn't the world be a better place if everyone was _too_ polite to each other?

Unfortunately, you can have too much of a good thing. These seemingly-polite courtesies create dangerous situations and force bicycle riders to make uncomfortable decisions. To accept means illegally biking into traffic, and to reject means being rude.

When a car stops unexpectedly, someone on a bicycle usually isn't able to tell why, and whether or not the car will unexpectedly start again a moment later. There may be other cars driving nearby, and there's no telling whether or not they will also stop. Accepting the driver's apparent kindness puts the bicycle rider at risk of a crash.

People on bicycles should always reject these courtesies, even if it seems rude. The kindest thing that drivers can do is simply drive predictably and obey the traffic laws.
