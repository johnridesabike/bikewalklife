Georgia Tech partnered with Georgia Department of Transportation to create the state's first-ever report of bicycling's economic impact. It shows that bicycles create close to $500 million in value.

[You can read the announcement and the report on GA Tech's website here](https://econ.gatech.edu/news/item/649834/first-ever-study-bicycling-georgia-shows-million-economic-impact).

> \[Shatakshee Dhongde's\] analysis shows that Georgia’s biking industry has a total annual impact of more than $496 million and employs 4,529 people. Breaking down these numbers reveals that bicycle-related businesses generated $361 million, trail construction created $124 million, and events and organizations accounted for $10 million.

I haven't read the complete report yet, but it appears conservative at a glance. According to the executive summary:

> Based on the existing literature, the report undertakes an economic impact analysis of the following categories:
>
> 1. Bicycle-related businesses.
> 2. Bicycle trails.
> 3. Bicycling organizations and events.

These categories don't seem like they can encapsulate all of the economic benefits that bicycling offers. For example, a bike commuter can create economic value without ever visiting a bicycle-related business or attending a bicycling event. The most often-cited economic advantage to bike commuting is in how it _saves_ the commuter money. **Bicycles are not just consumer goods, but can be tools that generate value for their riders as well.** That is valuable but not measurable in the same way that business revenue is.

The report also contains a stark reality: a mere 0.2% of Georgia's population rides a bicycle to work. This isn't completely an accident. Our towns have been deliberately designed to prioritize car transportation at the expense of all other options. This car-oriented design is much more expensive than most alternatives, especially bicycling. In order to fully realize the possible economic benefits of bicycling, we need a radical shift in our culture and our infrastructure.

[Pattie Baker has a nice take on the report](https://travelingatthespeedofbike.com/2021/08/27/1st-ever-economic-impact-report-and-its-a-significant-under-estimate/):

> The economic growth opportunity in our state is astronomical if and when we create safe-access-for-all that meets NACTO guidelines. Therefore, no more greenwashing with too-narrow, unprotected paint-on-the-road or disconnected networks with frequent blockages! They are direct barriers to achieving our economic potential, at a time when that is needed more than ever.

Nonetheless, it's unarguably valuable to have reports like this. I hope that in the future we'll get to see more bicycling research for Georgia and for other regions where it's currently lacking.
