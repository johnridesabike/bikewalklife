Georgia Tech partnered with Georgia Department of Transportation to create the state's first-ever report of bicycling's economic impact. The study shows that bicycles create close to $500 million in revenue.

[You can read the announcement, and the report, on GA Tech's website here](https://econ.gatech.edu/news/item/649834/first-ever-study-bicycling-georgia-shows-million-economic-impact).

> To complete the study, Dhongde collected data on three economic activities over the last five years: the sales revenue and employment records of more than 700 bicycling businesses, the construction and maintenance costs of more than 80 bike trails, and the budget, participants, and employees of more than 60 events and 30 bicycling organizations in the state of Georgia.
>
> Her analysis shows that Georgia’s biking industry has a total annual impact of more than $496 million and employs 4,529 people. Breaking down these numbers reveals that bicycle-related businesses generated $361 million, trail construction created $124 million, and events and organizations accounted for $10 million.

I haven't read the complete report yet, but it seems conservative at a glance. According to the executive summary:

> Based on the existing literature, the report undertakes an economic impact analysis of the following categories:
>
> 1. Bicycle-related businesses.
> 2. Bicycle trails.
> 3. Bicycling organizations and events.

These categories don't seem like they can encapsulate all of the economic benefits that bicycling offers. For example, a bike commuter can generate economic value without ever visiting a bicycle-related business or attending a bicycling event. Or consider that the most often-cited economic advantage to bike commuting is in how it _saves_ the commuter money. That is valuable as well, but not measurable in the same way that revenue is.

The report also contains a stark reality: a mere 0.2% of Georgia's population rides a bicycle to work. This isn't completely an accident. Our towns have been deliberately designed to prioritize car transportation at the expense of all other options. In order to fully realize the economic benefits of bicycling that's possible, we need a radical shift in our culture and our infrastructure.

[Pattie Baker has a nice take on the report](https://travelingatthespeedofbike.com/2021/08/27/1st-ever-economic-impact-report-and-its-a-significant-under-estimate/):

> The economic growth opportunity in our state is astronomical if and when we create safe-access-for-all that meets NACTO guidelines. Therefore, no more greenwashing with too-narrow, unprotected paint-on-the-road or disconnected networks with frequent blockages! They are direct barriers to achieving our economic potential, at a time when that is needed more than ever.
