Our 21st century roads are too expensive. By using bicycles for transportation, we save ourselves and our neighbors an enormous amount of money in road maintenance. 

Planetizien has a new article about this: [Biking's Billion-Dollar Value, Right Under Our Wheels](https://www.planetizen.com/features/113986-bikings-billion-dollar-value-right-under-our-wheels) by Richard Dion.

> Reconstructing existing lanes for a four-lane, five-mile road in a large, urbanized environment (nearly $3 million x 5 miles x 4 lanes) is over $58 million. To resurface those same lanes would cost about $17.9 million. That certainly is not cheap.

> Not only are bikes significantly lighter and thus less damaging to roads, they also do not come with the constant drip of fluids from cars in traffic, which breaks up asphalt quicker over the long-term.

These are "invisible" costs. Most people aren't aware of them, and indeed it would be hard to accurately guess them just by looking at a road. In an era where calling to cut government spending is fashionable, perhaps that is why transportation spending is largely exempt from mainstream criticism. For the average citizen, anything less than the status quo seems unthinkable. 

Yet these invisible dollar amounts are only part of the problem. We can see the the many external costs as well: wider roads, giant parking lots, personal costs of car upkeep, noise, exhaust, crashes (including deaths), to name a few. Even if we can justify them, but no one can deny them.

Dion concludes his article with the proposition that this can be helped by marketing

> It would bring no greater value to the United States than having a core of America's best marketers to communicate the billion-dollar advantage of biking.
