America Walks, the walking advocacy group, has a new guest post from Noah Lenstra on how to team up with your local library and improve walking in your community. 

You can read the whole post here: [How and Why to Team up with your local librarian](https://americawalks.org/how-and-why-to-team-up-with-your-local-librarian/).

> Who is working with public librarians, and what are they doing with them? By understanding [public librarians as partners](https://www.shareable.net/rules-of-the-road-partnering-with-public-libraries-for-collective-impact/), you too unlock their potential for your community’s walking movement.

He then lists ten different walking projects that libraries worked with. Not only is the list diverse, with libraries from Toronto to Florida, it is also quite timely. They all occurred between June 21 and June 30 of this year.

If you're looking for a partner to help with a walking project, or if you're a library staffer looking for inspiration, then this guide looks like a handy resource.
