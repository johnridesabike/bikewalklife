I've toyed with the idea of documenting my bike commutes for a while, and this challenge served as a good excuse to test it out. In my observations, most people have no idea what bike commuting is like. Unless you actually get on two wheels and ride through your community, then it's hard to even be aware of of the issues bicycle riders deal with. It's my hope that videos like these can not only raise awareness of the problems, but also help biking look more approachable so people can feel confident to start riding.

I had fun filming these, and I'm going to aim to produce more in the future. [Let me know](https://bikewalk.life/contact/) if you're dying to see anything in particular about the bike commute experience!
