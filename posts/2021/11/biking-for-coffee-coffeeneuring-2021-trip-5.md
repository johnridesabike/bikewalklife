This is my fifth video in my Biking for Coffee series. As part of this year’s Coffeeneuring Challenge, I’m documenting each of my rides on video to show what a typical bike commute can look like in my community.

This was my first night ride for the challenge. If you don't mind the darkness, then this was my easiest route so far. It was entirely on a biking and walking trail, so the usual problems of traffic and navigation were not an issue. I also got to patronize a trail-side business!

Qualifying coffeeneuring details: This ride took place on Wednesday, November 3. The total distance was about 4.6 miles.
