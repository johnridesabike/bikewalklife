This is my sixth video in my Biking for Coffee series. As part of this year’s Coffeeneuring Challenge, I’m documenting each of my rides on video to show what a typical bike commute can look like in my community.

This is another route that I personally ride often when I commute to our downtown. It's very similar to [my previous ride where I took the riverwalk trail](https://bikewalk.life/2021/11/biking-for-coffee-coffeeneuring-2021-trip-3/). Except, instead of the riverwalk, I circled around downtown in the other direction. This was less scenic, but a shorter distance. Either route takes you to the same place. 

Qualifying coffeeneuring details: This ride took place on Saturday, November 6. The total distance was about 4.2 miles.
