This is my third video in my Biking for Coffee series. As part of this year's Coffeeneuring Challenge, I'm documenting each of my rides on video to show what a typical bike commute can look like in my community.

This ride was one of the more scenic and "touristy" of my coffeeneuring rides, but it's still a practical route for commuting. I regularly take my bike on routes similar to this. The trail system does an an excellent job at connecting our downtown area to the sprawling suburbs.

Qualifying coffeeneuring details: This ride took place on Sunday, October 24. The total distance was about 7.2 miles.
