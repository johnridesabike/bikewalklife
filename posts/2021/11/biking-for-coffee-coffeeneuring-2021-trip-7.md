For my closing coffeeneuring ride this year, I revisited the neighborhood from my first video. This route features almost no bicycle infrastructure, but it's still bike-friendly. It shows how even places that don't treat bicycles as first-class citizens can have a lot of potential for bicycling.

Qualifying coffeeneuring details: This ride took place on Saturday, November 13. The total distance was about 2.8 miles.
