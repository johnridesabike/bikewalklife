This is my fourth video in my Biking for Coffee series. As part of this year’s Coffeeneuring Challenge, I’m documenting each of my rides on video to show what a typical bike commute can look like in my community.

This ride is special because it's also part of my regular commuting route. You get to see what a real-life bike commute looks like in Columbus, Georgia! 

Qualifying coffeeneuring details: This ride took place on Wednesday, October 27. The total distance was about 4.4 miles.
