## Errand 11: breakfast

I already visited one coffee shop earlier during this challenge, so I mixed it up this day and rode to [Parker's Pantry](https://www.facebook.com/parkerspantryatthepark/). It's a restaurant right by one of Columbus' main public parks. In spite of the area's lack of official bike parking, it's a pleasant place to bike or walk to.

## Errand 12: bike around Midtown

On the final day of my 12-day errand spree, I joined a group ride around the Midtown area. This was an official event sponsored by [Midtown, Inc.](https://midtowncolumbusga.org/) and came with a police escort. This neighborhood is already quite bikable, so the escort was more of a bonus than an necessity. Anyone comfortable on a bike could follow the same route on their own.
