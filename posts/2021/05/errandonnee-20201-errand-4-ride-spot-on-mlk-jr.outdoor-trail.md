For my fourth Errandonnee ride, I explored the new MLK Jr. Outdoor Trail, which is a series of historic markers along the Dragonfly Trail Network in Columbus, GA. Each of the markers recalls the civil rights movement as it happened in Columbus.

This ride would easily fit in the "history lesson" category, but I went with "discovery" since the route was completely new to me. I was pleased to find that the trail itself was very pleasant. Sadly, it suffers a problem common for bike infrastructure, which is that it is disconnected from most other useful trails or bike lanes. However, I'm optimistic that this condition is temporary. The trail itself is still under construction on one end, and the other end is so close to downtown that riding between them is only a little awkward.

But my real disappointment was that I embarked on the trail to visit all eleven historic markers and only was able to reach five. The remaining six that make up the "MLK Jr. Outdoor Learning Trail" are beyond where the physical trail ends. I explored a bit on foot, but even the sidewalk has crumbled and washed away. Considering that this area has multiple lanes of dangerous car traffic, I cannot recommend for anyone to try visiting all of markers at once.

To make this a real _errand_, opposed to a recreational ride, I charted it on Ride Spot. [You can view it and follow along on Ride Spot here](https://ridespot.org/rides/302520 ). This is my first time using that app, so I hope I did everything correctly.
