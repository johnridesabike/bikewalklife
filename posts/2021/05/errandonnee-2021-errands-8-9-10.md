Errandonnee is a challenge where you have 12 days to complete 12 errands by bicycle or on foot. This page is part of a series of my entries for the 2021 challenge.

Bike Week has officially begun just as I'm nearing the end of my errand spree. Here are my latest three entries before the finishing stretch.

## Errand 8: biking to work

I bike to work most days already, so this almost didn't feel like a real errand to me. I'm privileged to have a commute route that mostly consists of bike paths, bike lanes, flat elevation, and light car traffic. The few spots where I need to climb a hill or cross traffic are relatively safe and manageable.

Pictured below is my bicycle on my commute route with its super-professional-business-looking Ortlieb Urban pannier.

## Errand 9: church again

Sure, this seems like it's the same "errand" as [my very first one](https://bikewalk.life/2021/05/errandonnee-2021-errands-1-and-2/), but I'm pretty certain that it still counts. (It's really been a week since I began this challenge?)

## Errand 10: coffeeneuring

It's a crossover episode today. If you're unfamiliar with _coffeeneuring_, it's errandonneering's little sibling, an annual challenge where we ride our bikes to drink hot beverages. For this errand, I rode to one of our local coffee shops, [Midtown Coffee House](https://www.midtowncoffeehouse.com/), for breakfast.
