Bike week has begun, and I'm nearing the end of my bicycle errand spree.

## Errand 8: biking to work

I bike to work most days already, so this almost didn't feel like a real errand to me. I'm privileged to have a commute route that's mostly bike paths, bike lanes, flat, and light on car traffic. The few spots where I do need to climb a hill or cross heavy traffic are relatively safe and manageable. ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/bike-walk-life/image/upload/t_md_body_retina/f_auto,q_auto/v1621268619/2021/IMG_8443_njroxq.jpg)

## Errand 9: church part 2

Sure, this seems like it's the same "errand" as my very first one, but I'm pretty certain that it still counts. Has it really been a week since I began? (Of course it has, since time still works like that.)

## Errand 10: coffeeneuring

It's a crossover episode today. If you're familiar with _coffeeneuring_, it's the little-sibling to errandonneering, an annual challenge where we ride our bikes to drink hot beverages. For this errand, I rode to one of my local coffee shops, Midtown Coffee House, for breakfast.
