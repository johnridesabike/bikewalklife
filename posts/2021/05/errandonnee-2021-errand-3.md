## Errand 3: Midtown art

For my third errand, I toured the latest public art in the Columbus, GA Midtown area. (Yes, visiting public art is an errand!) I rode past the murals along 13th Street and local folk artist Ralph Frank Jr's place.

There is a *lot* of great art in this area, and the above photos don't do it justice. If you're in Columbus, then I recommend checking out these places in person.
