## Errand 5: beer run

This one was short and simple. I stopped by Maltitude, our local craft beer store, after work. One detail that makes Maltitude a pleasure to visit is that it has **indoor bicycle parking**! The owners are big bicycle supporters, so I'm happy to support them in turn.

## Errand 6: historic district

The Columbus, GA historic district is full of, well, history. Not only in the architecture, but also memorialized in its parks and public spaces. There are many preserved artifacts from the city's past on display, as well as plaques and markers. (As tends to happen with these things, some of them have aged better than others.) Pictured below is one particularly notable monument which honors the Confederate dead. Most monuments for the Confederacy we see today were erected in recent history as a rebuke to the civil rights movement, but this one is different in that it was put up in 1879 by people who were still mourning the deaths of their relatives. For this reason, it has so far survived challenges for removal.

## Errand 7: fishing in the Chattahoochee

I've never gone fishing by bicycle before, so before this I was mentally preparing to engineer a complex contraption to transport my tackle. It turned out to be much simpler than I expected, which also made this a slightly disappointing entry for the "you carried WHAT?!" category. The key to my simplicity was that my top-tube bag and my rack cooler both have plenty of Velcro that can easily strap down a rod. All I needed to do then was fold it up and stash the rest of my tackle in a pannier. 

Another disappointment was that the fish weren't biting today. But I still had a great ride nonetheless.
