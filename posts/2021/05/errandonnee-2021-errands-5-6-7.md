## Errand 5: beer run

This one was short and simple. I stopped by [Maltitude](http://maltitude.com/), our local craft beer store, after work. One feature that makes Maltitude a pleasure to visit is that it has **indoor bicycle parking**! The owners are big bicycle supporters, so I'm happy to support them in return.

## Errand 6: historic district

The Columbus, GA historic district is full of, well, history. There's history in its architecture, its street designs, and in its parks and public spaces. It contains artifacts from the city's past along with plaques and markers.

(As tends to happen with these things, some of their messages have aged better than others.)

Pictured below is one notable monument for the Confederate dead. Most of these kinds of monuments were built recently in rebuke to the civil rights movement, but this one was erected in 1879. Partially for that reason, it has so far survived challenges for removal. I believe its most recent challenge was in 2017, [which you can read about here](https://www.ledger-enquirer.com/latest-news/article167739002.html).

## Errand 7: fishing in the Chattahoochee

I've never gone fishing by bicycle before, so I didn't know what to expect. At first, I was mentally preparing to engineer a complex contraption to transport my tackle. This task turned out to be much simpler than I expected (which also made this a slightly disappointing entry for the "you carried WHAT?!" category). The key to its simplicity was that my top-tube bag and my rack cooler both have plenty of Velcro that can easily strap down a rod. All I needed to do then was fold the rod and stash the rest of my tackle in a pannier.

Another disappointment was that the fish weren't biting today. But I still had a great ride nonetheless.
