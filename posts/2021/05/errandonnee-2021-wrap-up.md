Errandonnee is a challenge where you have 12 days to complete 12 errands by bicycle or on foot. This post completes my series of entries for the 2021 challenge.

[You can read more about Errandonnee here](https://chasingmailboxes.com/2021/04/11/errandonnee-2021-hyperlocal-edition/).

I finished my Errandonnee challenge last week. It was a lot of fun, but a surprising amount of work. I bike commute a lot every week, but I usually follow a few basic routes for regular necessities. The Errandonnee rules require that you try a variety of "errands" and encourage creativity. Some of my rides ended up being much further and more complicated than I expected. If you haven't started yours yet, or if you plan to participate in upcoming years, then my advice is to make a plan with a schedule and stick to it.

## Statistics

<dl>
<dt>Date range</dt>
<dd>May 9 through May 20</dd>
<dt>Total errands</dt>
<dd>12</dd>
<dt>Total mileage</dt>
<dd>67 miles</dd>
</dl>

The mileage is a conservative estimation since I didn't always run my GPS. I stopped worrying about it once it was clear I'd be well over the minimum of 30 miles anyway.

## Errands list

* Errand 1, May 9: church.
* Errand 2, May 9: grocery shopping.
* Errand 3, May 10: Midtown art.
* Errand 4, May 11: MLK Jr. Outdoor Learning Trail.
