Errandonnee is a challenge where you have 12 days to complete 12 errands by bicycle or on foot. This page is part of a series of my entries for the 2021 challenge.

## Errand 1: church

My first "errand" was a bike ride down to my regular church in downtown Columbus, GA. Thanks to the Dragonfly Trail Network that connects my neighborhood to downtown, this is a very pleasant ride. Car traffic is less dangerous on Sunday too, which is nice.

## Errand 2: grocery shopping

I had only planned one ride for this day, but some of our staples were low and the weather was beautiful, so I took my bike down to our neighborhood's Piggly Wiggly. Even though there are almost no bike lanes here, it's still a nice ride. I'm able to stay on low-traffic, residential streets surrounded by trees for most of the trip.
