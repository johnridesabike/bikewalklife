## Errand 1: church

My first "errand" was a bike ride down to my regular church in downtown Columbus, GA. Thanks to the Dragonfly Trail Network that connects my neighborhood to the downtown area, this is always a pleasant ride. And the car traffic is always less scary on Sunday too, which always helps.

## Errand 2: grocery shopping

I had only planned one ride for this day, but some of our staples were low and the weather was beautiful, so I took my bike down to the Piggly Wiggly. Even though there are few bike lanes or trails, I'm able to ride here on low-traffic, residential streets surrounded by trees. There are only a couple of hills that can make this ride a chore sometimes.
