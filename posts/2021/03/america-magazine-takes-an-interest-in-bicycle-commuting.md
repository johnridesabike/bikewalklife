Another non-bicycle publication has a new article about the merits of bicycling. [John Miller, writing for America, argues that bicycles may be the solution to our many modern problems](https://www.americamagazine.org/arts-culture/2021/03/16/bikes-transportation-catholic-social-teaching-240216):

> What would Jesus ride? For this pilgrim, the answer is obvious. The technological incarnation of love—for yourself, for your neighbor and for the planet—is a sleek aluminum frame, mounted by a human rider, propelled by two wheels, powered by pedals, crank and chain.

> It is hard to name a societal ill that cannot be addressed by societies choosing bikes over cars _en masse_. And this engine of peace is already invented, perfected and mass-produced. There are an [estimated two billion bicycles](https://web.worldbank.org/archive/website01603/WEB/BIKE.HTM) in the world. In 30 years, there could be as many as five billion. It can’t happen soon enough.

He presents a solid case for the various benefits of bicycles, but also he adds some important historical context to them. A little over 100 years ago, bicycles were a revolutionary invention. Even though our interstates and suburbs keep car culture dominant today, the promise that bicycles offer is still there. 

Readers will probably notice some arguments familiar to the bicycle-blog world. It's always nice to see when these points get traction in circles that aren't bicycle/mobility/urbanism focused.
