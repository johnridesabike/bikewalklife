In the pilot episode, Scott interviews [John Bennett](https://www.johnreidbennett.com/), the Safety Education Programs Manager for[ Georgia Bikes](https://georgiabikes.org/). They discuss topics ranging from Bennett's history of advocacy in Savannah, to e-bikes, to the new "bike boom" set off by recent lockdowns.

One small detail I enjoyed was when Bennett referred to himself as a "walkist" when he walked around Savannah. As I've written previously, [we really need a better word for "person who walks."](https://bikewalk.life/2021/02/do-we-need-a-better-word-for-pedestrian/) I'm not sure if _walkist_ is the right one, but I do like it better than the status quo of _pedestrian._
