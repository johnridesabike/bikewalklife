I’m a big fan of these kinds of challenges. They mix athleticism, adventure, creativity, and just having fun on a bicycle. The world could use more events like this. And although these aren’t new, they’re a great fit for our socially-distant era.

Alas, I ride with a derailleurs, so I won’t qualify for this year. Perhaps I’ll go to the dark side by 2022.
