We all recognize the big bicycle categories, mountain biking, BMX, cyclocross, touring, and commuting to name a few. But when we zoom-in to look at commuting, then the landscape seems less neatly categorized. Even though commuters may collectively use diverse styles of bicycles and equipment, they all seem to be doing basically the same thing with them. Although they look the same, I like to think of commuting as three basic modes. These modes aren’t based on kind of bicycle or gear you use, but in your *mindset* and *behavior*.

* Mode one: you ride your bicycle as if you’re walking, but faster.
* Mode two: you ride your bicycle as if you’re running, but faster.
* Mode three: you ride your bicycle as if you’re driving a car, but slower.

Either consciously or unconsciously, you probably fall into one of these modes when you bike commute. Our transportation system is overwhelmingly designed for mode three. Trail systems are generally designed for mode two. Mode one is usually not a consideration in our towns.

Are either of these superior to the others? Let’s dive a bit deeper into each one’s characteristics.

## Mode one: riding a bicycle as if you’re walking, except faster.

Imagine you want to walk somewhere. It could be down the street, across the neighborhood, or anywhere that would normally being a comfortable walk. But even a pleasant walk can be time consuming. With a bicycle, you can turn a 30-minute walk into a 5-minute ride, and you don’t even need to get your heart rate up. You probably don’t need any special clothing or gear (besides maybe a basket because you can’t use your arms while riding).

Yes, by “no gear” I mean no helmet too. If that seems scandalous, do you wear a helmet or put on special shoes to walk down the street? 

## Mode two: riding a bicycle as if you’re running, except faster.

If you commute on trails or bike paths, then this may sound familiar. You probably do a bit of extra prep before leaving, possibly putting on workout clothes and packing an outfit for changing. You know you will break a sweat before you get to your destination.

This mode puts more importance on the gear. You will certainly wear a helmet. And even if you don’t have the fastest racing bicycle, you want to make sure your bicycle is well maintained. 

## Mode three: riding a bicycle as if you’re driving a car, except slower.

Once you leave your neighborhood, then this mode takes over. Legally, this is how you’re “supposed” to ride a bicycle on the street. Most states consider bicycles a type of vehicle and are thus subject to the same privileges and responsibilities that cars have. 

When you do this, you always wear a helmet, signal your turns, ride with traffic, “take the lane,” stop at red lights, and wear reflective clothing.

## Which is best? It’s like a food pyramid.

There’s rarely a “best” or “optimal” mode, only different ones for different situations. However, our transportation system’s overemphasis on mode three has created an inverted “food pyramid,” where the least enjoyable and least accessible mode is expected to be used the most.

I don’t want to knock the rules of the road, but most people don’t want to be literally a vehicle when they’re on a bicycle. It feels unnatural and dehumanizing to move your body with automobile traffic. It’s also extremely stressful, especially for someone who isn’t accustomed to it. Most people quickly realize that turning yourself into a “car, but slower” means that you might as well just drive a car, because you’ve forfeited all of the benefits you would normally get from riding a bicycle.

Biking as if you’re walking however, is a pleasure. There’s no stress about if you have the “right” kind of bicycle, what you’re wearing, or what the traffic is like. Of course, this presupposes that you live in a walkable area in the first place, which is not the reality for most of us in the US.

I’m a huge fan of bicycling, but mainly as long as it goes hand-in-hand with walking. I believe that our daily lives should be spent mostly walking (the base of the pyramid), with some bicycling if necessary (the middle of the pyramid), and driving cars only occasionally (the tip of the pyramid). Each mode of transportation has its uses, but only walking should occupy most of our time.

When you see bicycle infrastructure around your town, what kind of bicycling is it for? Is it for no-stress, leisurely rides around the neighborhood (mode one)? Or is it for riding in hectic traffic (mode three)? Which kind actually encourages people to ride bicycles?
