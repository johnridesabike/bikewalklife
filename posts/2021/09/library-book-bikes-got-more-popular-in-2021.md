Book bikes are a growing trend for public libraries. They allow library staff to perform bookmobile-style outreach on two, or usually three, wheels. This past August had the second annual "Book Bike Week," and interest doubled since last year.

[Public Libraries Online has the whole story here](http://publiclibrariesonline.org/2021/08/library-book-bikes-gaining-in-popularity/).

> According to David Kelsey, ABOS \[Association of Bookmobile and Outreach Services\] President, “Book bikes are a valuable library outreach vehicle that are essential in connecting communities with books and materials from across the United States and around the world. Book bikes have the unique capability of popping up in neighborhoods and other community gathering places, providing library service to individuals who may never walk through the doors of a library building. Not only do book bikes meet library patrons at their point of need, but book bikes also celebrate and promote health, movement, exercise, and getting outdoors.”
>
> In its second year, interest in Book Bike Week has doubled, with over 100 book bike programs across the United States and around the world submitting photos, testimonials, tips and tricks to this year’s social media celebration.

The Public Libraries Online article also has information about how your library can acquire and make use of its own book bike.

I'm slightly timid about putting too much weight into exact numbers right now, since 2020 and 2021 have brought so much disruption that has yet to settle. However, it's hard to see this as anything but good news. Let's hope that book bike usage continues to grow in 2022.
