Book bikes are a growing trend for public libraries, where they can perform bookmobile-style outreach on two (or usually three) wheels. This past August was the second annual "book bike week," and interest doubled since last year.

[Public Libraries Online has the whole story here](http://publiclibrariesonline.org/2021/08/library-book-bikes-gaining-in-popularity/). 

> According to David Kelsey, ABOS \[Association of Bookmobile and Outreach Services\] President, “Book bikes are a valuable library outreach vehicle that are essential in connecting communities with books and materials from across the United States and around the world. Book bikes have the unique capability of popping up in neighborhoods and other community gathering places, providing library service to individuals who may never walk through the doors of a library building. Not only do book bikes meet library patrons at their point of need, but book bikes also celebrate and promote health, movement, exercise, and getting outdoors.”

> In its second year, interest in Book Bike Week has doubled, with over 100 book bike programs across the United States and around the world submitting photos, testimonials, tips and tricks to this year’s social media celebration.

I personally am timid about putting too much weight into trends right now, since 2020 and 2021 have brought so much disruption that has yet to settle. However, it's hard to see this as anything but good news. Let's hope that the trend continues into 2022.
