When riding a bicycle, it's well-known etiquette to warn other people when you approach to pass them. Most cyclists around here shout "on your left!" I don't like shouting at people, so I installed a bell on my handlebars. But either one works. This past week, I encountered another style in the wild.

As I was biking down the street, a voice behind me shouted, "good morning!" and a moment later a man on bicycle rode past.

It was an ordinary situation, but it stuck with me. Perhaps this says something about the culture of my town, but I've never noticed a bicycle rider say "good morning" (or afternoon, or evening) to alert me of their passing. The politeness that the phrase carries was refreshing.

In our post-etiquette world, we have a tendency to reinvent common courtesies as soon as we realize they have a practical purpose. Most of the time, our reinventions are woefully utilitarian. Case in point: "on your left" to signal that you are approaching someone on their left.

Riding a bicycle in most of our communities can already feel dismal and oppressive at times. Why not add some charm and politeness to it? As much as I like the convenience of my bell, I may start using some more classic courtesies to my technique.
