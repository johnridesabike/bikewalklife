Biketober is an annual month-long event held in the Atlanta area every October (in case its name didn't make that clear). It's a just-for-fun competition where participants earn points for riding their bicycles.

[Read more at the official Biketober website](https://www.lovetoride.net/atlanta).

Some local groups are hosting their own events for it. [You can see Be Active Decatur's announcement about it here](https://beactivedecatur.com/2021/09/24/biketober-starts-next-friday/).

[Pattie Baker, of Traveling at the Speed of Bike, has a calendar of events here](https://travelingatthespeedofbike.com/2021/09/25/biketober-calendar-2/).

And if you're not in the Atlanta area (just like me) then there's still the [2021 Coffeeneuring challenge coming up on October 18th](https://chasingmailboxes.com/2021/09/23/coffeeneuring-challenge-2021-starts-october-18/). There's no shortage of excuses to get out and ride your bicycle this fall.
