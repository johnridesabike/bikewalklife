[Read more at the official Biketober website](https://www.lovetoride.net/atlanta).

Some local groups are hosting their own events for it. For instance,  [you can see Be Active Decatur's announcement about it here](https://beactivedecatur.com/2021/09/24/biketober-starts-next-friday/).

[Pattie Baker, of Traveling at the Speed of Bike, has made a calendar of Biketober events](https://travelingatthespeedofbike.com/2021/09/25/biketober-calendar-2/).

And if you're not in the Atlanta area (like me) then there's still the [2021 Coffeeneuring challenge coming up on October 18th](https://chasingmailboxes.com/2021/09/23/coffeeneuring-challenge-2021-starts-october-18/). We have no shortage of excuses to get out and ride our bicycles this fall.
