The New York Times opinion section published an article by Farhad Manjoo, [There’s One Big Problem With Electric Cars](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/opinion/electric-cars-SUV.html?smid=tw-share). He cuts right to the chase on the first line: “They’re still cars. Technology can’t cure America of its addiction to the automobile.” 

> That problem isn’t just gas-fueled cars but car-fueled lives — a view of the world in which huge private automobiles are the default method of getting around. In this way E.V.s represent a very American answer to climate change: To deal with an expensive, dangerous, extremely resource-intensive machine that has helped bring about the destruction of the planet, let’s all buy this new version, which runs on a different fuel.

This issue is why I’m often hesitant to discuss the fossil fuels when I write against car culture. The ongoing climate crisis just hasn’t been an effective deterrence. Even for people sympathetic to the crisis, they’re more likely to drive a [greenwashed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing) car than they are to live car-free. The problem is that people cannot imagine living without cars.

There are also many, many reasons to wage the “warn on SUVs” besides their emissions. One of the most underreported, but most scandalous, is that they literally kill people. Not with their exhaust, but with their bullbars. SUVs and pickup trucks are responsible for the most deaths on the road. Emissions and fuel taxes can feel like abstract concerns, but traffic crashes are a real concern for almost everyone.

What we don’t need to do is guilt car owners into just buying a different kind of car. We need to work to offer mobility alternatives that free drivers from the cycle of car ownership.
