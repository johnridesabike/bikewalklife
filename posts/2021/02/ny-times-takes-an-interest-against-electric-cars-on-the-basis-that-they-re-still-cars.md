The New York Times opinion section published an article by Farhad Manjoo, [There’s One Big Problem With Electric Cars](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/opinion/electric-cars-SUV.html?smid=tw-share), and He cuts right to the chase on the first line. “They’re still cars. Technology can’t cure America of its addiction to the automobile.”

> That problem isn’t just gas-fueled cars but car-fueled lives — a view of the world in which huge private automobiles are the default method of getting around. In this way E.V.s represent a very American answer to climate change: To deal with an expensive, dangerous, extremely resource-intensive machine that has helped bring about the destruction of the planet, let’s all buy this new version, which runs on a different fuel.

This is why I’m often hesitant to discuss the fossil fuels when I write against car culture. It’s clear that the ongoing climate crisis is an ineffective talking point. Even for people sympathetic to the crisis, they’re more likely to drive a [greenwashed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing) car than they are to live car-free. The problem is that people simply cannot imagine living without their automobiles.

I think that’s fine, because there are many other reasons to wage the [war on SUVs](https://bikewalk.life/2020/09/on-pushing-back-against-suvs/). One of the most underreported, but most scandalous, is that they literally kill people. Not with their exhaust, but with their bullbars. [The more SUVs and pickup trucks we put on the street, the more people die](https://bikewalk.life/2020/08/study-larger-vehicles-wider-roads-increased-deaths/). Emissions and fuel taxes can feel like abstract concerns, but traffic crashes are a real concern for almost everyone.

What we don’t need to do is guilt car owners into just buying a different kind of car. We need to work to offer mobility alternatives that free drivers from the cycle of car ownership.
