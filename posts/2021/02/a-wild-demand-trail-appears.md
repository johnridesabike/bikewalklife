Despite our culture’s reverence to free market ideology, our transportation doesn’t neatly fit in with it. People continuously wish for some alternative transportation option, but we remain dependent on our technocratic overlords and their car-centric master-plan. Nonetheless, there are occasional times when individuals empower themselves to take mobility into their own hands. The laws of supply and demand relent, and a “demand trail” appears.

[I blogged about a local demand trail last year](https://bikewalk.life/2020/09/a-demand-trail-meets-a-stroad/). These occur when regular pedestrian traffic goes off the official paved paths and blazes its own trail, or rather when a trail is “demanded” but not officially supplied. They indicate a disconnect between the plans of transportation officials and of the transportation users themselves.

This new trail is off Willis Road. The road runs alongside several homes for about a quarter-mile before it ends in a cul-de-sac. There is nothing officially around that cul-de-sac, no infrastructure or developed properties. But just a few feet downhill is a heavily-used segment of the Dragonfly Trail. I’ve walked between the road and the trail often, through mud and up a sometimes-slippery slope, and I wondered why there isn’t any official connection between the two. The cul-de-sac could easily be a parking lot for people to use the trail, or a park, or anything. Surely, I’ve wondered, I can’t be the only one who sees this?

It turns out that I wasn’t. Recently, some enterprising citizens took matters into their own hands. They used bricks and scrap wood and made an unofficial trail. I have no idea who did this, whether it was an individual or a group project, nor do I know anything else about it. While it may not look like much, it’s better than nothing.

As a side note, this situation limits how useful GPS apps are when they’re used for biking and walking, which is something I mentioned [when I wrote about TandemTrip app last year](https://bikewalk.life/2020/10/tandemtrip-a-potential-waze-for-cycling-app/). When routes have unofficial connections that are obvious to humans, but that aren’t recognized by computers, then apps aren’t always able to provide optimal routes.

We may not be able to go make our own sidewalks and bike lanes where we need them on our own, but sometimes even the smallest things make a big difference. It’s also important for us to continuously voice our concerns to our city leaders. Unless they’re the ones biking and walking on our streets (usually they aren’t) then they have no way of knowing what we really need.
