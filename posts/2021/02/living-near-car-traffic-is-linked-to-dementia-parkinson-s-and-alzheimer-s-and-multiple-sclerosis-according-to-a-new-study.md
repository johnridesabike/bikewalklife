We all know that living near a busy arterial road is generally less pleasant than living near a verdant park. Most of us would prefer to live away from the noise and the ugly asphalt. But according to a study in *Environmental Health* journal, there’s another reason to avoid roads. The air pollution can be linked to dementia, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and multiple sclerosis.

The paper is titled “[Road proximity, air pollution, noise, green space and neurologic disease incidence: a population-based cohort study](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12940-020-0565-4)” and was published in 2020. [You can read it online for free](https://rdcu.be/ce6tM).

As with most scientific studies, it requires a some context for interpretation. The data comes from Vancouver. It shows that people who live near major roads have a higher chance of suffering from the aforementioned diseases, and that people who live near green spaces have a lower chance. It also compares data about the specific qualities of the different areas, such as various types of air pollution, noise levels, and the level of “greenness.” 

Notably, noise levels seemed to have no effect. Air pollution and greenness where both the main factors.

And like most scientific studies, it also requires a disclaimer. The data comes from the population as a whole by examining zip codes and vital statistics. The authors note that it can’t account for factors such as people with existing conditions moving (possibly moving somewhere to better treat their condition).

Despite its limitations, this study seems to affirm what most of us already assumed: that living near cars is bad for your health. Besides the risks of stress, obesity, and literal death by crash, we can add dementia and Parkinson’s to the risks. 

Even if we don’t know the exact science containing all of the risks of major roads, everyone knows they’re bad in general. This is why politically-influential communities (wealthy, white) work to keep highways away, and so highways are instead built in non-politically-influential communities (poor, nonwhite). We also tend to rationalize the dangers as necessary evils, the same way that we use language like “accident” to refer to avoidable traffic deaths.

But scientific research continues to show that deaths and diseases caused by car traffic are serious, and common sense shows that these situations are completely avoidable. (After all, we created the problem ourselves by building the cars and the roads.) Until public policy catches up, we have one more study to cite when someone asks why big roads are so bad.
