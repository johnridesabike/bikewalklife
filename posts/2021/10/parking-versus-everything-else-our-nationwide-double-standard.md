The average American is suspicious of, if not hostile to, public transportation spending. Sometimes these feelings are based on practical concerns from past failures, and sometimes they're based on ideologies. But that all goes out the window when we discuss parking lots.

Joe Cortright of Strong Towns and City Observatory published this satirical blog post recently: [Where We Embrace Socialism in the U.S.: Parking Lots](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2021/10/11/where-we-embrace-socialism-in-the-us-parking-lots). It responds to accusations that the newest federal spending program is un-American because it's "socialist:"

> That’s not accurate, of course. Socialism is well-established in the U.S., at least for car storage—something that is near and dear, certainly to Republicans. You think otherwise? Before you denounce socialism, Senator Rubio, consider this perspective.
>
> Comrades, rejoice! In the face of the counter-revolutionary, neo-liberal onslaught, there’s at least one arena where the people’s inalienable rights reign supreme: [parking](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2019/11/27/parking-dominates-our-cities-but-do-we-really-see-it).

In a stroke of coincidental timing, a few days later my [local newspaper reported that our city council approved $14M to help fund new parking garage at riverfront development](https://www.ledger-enquirer.com/article254948127.html).

> Columbus Council unanimously approved a modification request Tuesday for additional TAD funds to support the construction of a shared underground parking facility and “certain public infrastructure improvements,” according to the agenda item, for Riverfront Place, a 7.5-acre, mixed-use development by the Bradley Company.
>
> Last March, the council approved $38 million in TAD funding for the project. On Tuesday, the council approved an additional $14 million. 
>
> “(The Bradley Company) is doing great work, phenomenal work,” City Manager Isaiah Hugley said during the meeting. “And it is going to have phenomenal impact, not on just Uptown, but all of Columbus, Georgia.”
