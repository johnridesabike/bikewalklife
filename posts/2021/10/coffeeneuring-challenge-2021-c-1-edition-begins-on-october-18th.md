Coffeeneuring is back for 2021. That's the just-for-fun challenge where you play by riding your bike to get coffee a couple of times a week for six weeks. As far as these kinds of challenges go, it's one of the most low-key and accessible.

[You can the whole rules and guidelines on Chasing Mailboxes here](https://chasingmailboxes.com/2021/10/05/coffeeneuring-challenge-2021-the-c1-edition/).

> What is the optimal number of coffeeneuring rides you can complete during the Coffeeneuring Challenge? The rules say seven, but I venture to say it’s really c+1 — always one more than what you’ve done so far.

> The basics of the challenge are this:
>
> * over the course of 6’ish weeks,
> * ride your bike to 7 different places,
> * at least 2 miles round trip each time,
> * drink 7 cups of coffee (or similar), and
> * collect some proof of your coffeeneuring (either photos, Strava tracks, journal entries, etc.).

I look forward to participating again this year. Honestly, there's little reason for me _not_ to since the challenge is so simple and fun. Thank you, Chasing Mailboxes, for organizing this year after year.
