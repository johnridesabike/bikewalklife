Here is my second video in my Biking for Coffee series. For this year's Coffeeneuring Challenge, I'm documenting each of my rides on video to show what a typical bike ride looks like in my community.

Qualifying coffeeneuring details: This ride was on Saturday, October 23. The total distance was about 2.4 miles.
