Chris Arnade has been writing about America's poor communities for a while now. His book, _Dignity_, is was one of my favorite published in recent years. He's recently started a new blog on Substack called [Intellectual Inting](https://intellectualinting.substack.com/), where he is currently publishing a series of posts called "Walking America."

[You can read Intellectual Inting, and the Walking America posts, here.](https://intellectualinting.substack.com/)

Arnade doesn't discuss biking or walking, at least not the same way that I do on my own blog, but our interests still intersect. He goes out to meet the "back row" population, people who have been left behind in our shifting economy and culture, and get to know what they're really like.

One could easily connect his observations to an essay about how our car-centric transportation policy contributes to the "back row" and "front row" division, but I'm not interested in that right now (for once!). What strikes me about his "Walking America" posts is his process. He goes out and literally walks through communities that most people drive through, or drive past, and he sees things that most of us outsiders would never notice. 

I think this is a lesson for anyone who wants to advocate for mobility equity or the back-row population (to borrow his term) in general. Human society necessitates walking among, not driving through, to understand. A human habitat is one one that facilitates walking.

If you haven't, you can try walking from one side of your city to the other and see what you notice. Chances are, the things that you end up seeing from that perspective are the things that you should be focused on.
