[The 2020 Coffeeneuring Challenge](https://chasingmailboxes.com/2020/09/27/coffeeneuring-challenge-2020-one-good-thing/) was subtitled “One Good Thing” in recognition that the event could be at least _one_ silver lining in that wild year. This annual challenge has always been fun for me, and this past year was, thankfully, no different.

These entries were posted originally on my personal Instagram page, and reposted here for posterity.

## Ride one: October 10

For my first day of the challenge, I rode about 3.5 miles to Midtown Coffee House for coffee and breakfast. I managed to beat the remnants of hurricane Delta before it hits us later today.

## Ride two: October 14

I biked 7 miles downtown to Fountain City Coffee to have breakfast. I took a detour across the Chattahoochee river to ride the Alabama side of the river walk before looping around back towards home. Fountain City Coffee was great, as usual!

## Ride three: October 22

A 5.7 mile round trip to Iron Bank Coffee via our Dragonfly Trails. I enjoyed some breakfast on the sidewalk while I wrote a new Bike Walk Life blog post.

## Ride four: October 27

I biked 3.3 miles around the neighborhood to check out the Halloween decor this year. Coffeeneuring is a fun bike challenge where you have seven weeks to ride to seven places and drink coffee (or similar). For this ride, I stopped by Parker’s Pantry to get some to-go coffee and lunch.

## Ride five: November 3

For my fifth Coffeeneuring ride, I opted to bring my own coffee in a thermos and ride along the Columbus, GA riverwalk. I found the latest public art installation, We Cannot Walk Alone, then I stopped under a tree in the park to enjoy my coffee, away from the crowds and loud rapids.   
  
Total distance: 7.2 miles.

## Ride six: November 8

After my usual bike ride to church this morning, I headed to Fountain City Coffee for lunch. I always like riding on weekends because you see so many more people on the Dragonfly Trails here in Columbus. Plus the traffic is lighter, which always helps!  
  
I rode 6.75 miles and got home just before some gusty rain started drizzling on us.

## Ride seven: November 10

For my final Coffeeneuring 2020 ride, I visited the north end of the Columbus Riverwalk. This is the first time I’ve been here since they completed the expansion, and I have to say it’s impressive. The new bridge takes you up over the dam and through the old mill. I stopped on top for a while to drink my coffee (packed from home, since there aren’t any cafes way out here). I think this is one of the most (or THE most?) scenic areas in Columbus now. Absolutely worth riding (or walking).  
  
Total distance: 12.5 miles.
