[The 2020 Coffeeneuring Challenge](https://chasingmailboxes.com/2020/09/27/coffeeneuring-challenge-2020-one-good-thing/) was subtitled “One Good Thing” in recognition that the event could be at least _one_ silver lining in that wild year. This annual challenge has always been fun for me, and this past year was, thankfully, no different.
