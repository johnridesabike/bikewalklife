When the pandemic stopped cars around the world, there was a lot of buzz about about cities repurposing their empty streets. From California, to Florida, to France, you could find examples of streets officially turned into “car-free” parks or dining areas. Urbanists cheered on these projects. It seemed like one of the silver linings to an otherwise terrible year.

But it wasn’t so simple. [Bloomberg CityLab has an article by Laura Bliss](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/the-swift-disruptive-rise-of-slow-streets) which describes how some of these swift projects only disrupted the communities they aimed to help. She uses an example from Oakland:

> A few weeks into the project, a survey revealed that, while affluent, white and non-disabled residents were overwhelmingly proponents of the program, people of color, people with lower incomes, and people with disabilities reported much lower levels of awareness, use and support. Local nonprofits criticized the city for its lack of community outreach and for not focusing instead on more urgent pandemic-related issues. Some felt that the street closures themselves sent a mixed message.

Sadly, this isn’t an uncommon pattern. In 2019, Detroit received pushback against its free tree planting program for similar reasons, as [Bloomberg also reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-11/why-detroiters-didn-t-trust-city-tree-planting-efforts). The problem then wasn’t the trees themselves, it was the fact that the city wasn’t actually communicating with residents, and residents didn’t implicitly trust the city. 

The story on street closures is a bit more complex, because the closures themselves weren’t so straightforward. Bliss explains in her article that many of the city’s poorer residents were _more_ car-dependent during the pandemic than before, so closing streets to cars was counter-intuitive. Another issue is that street “safety” for them means much more than simply getting rid of cars.

I’ve written before about the importance of local leadership in reforming transportation. This episode shows that even city-level leadership isn’t always connected with the individual communities within their cities. There is no one-size-fits-all plan for every neighborhood. 

But I don’t want to sound discouraged about these projects or their proponents. The ideas behind them are great, even if their execution was sometimes misguided. Hopefully cities will learn from this experience and take a renewed interest in the specific needs of their residents.
