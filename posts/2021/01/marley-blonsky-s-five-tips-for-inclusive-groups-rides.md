Marley Blonsky recently blogged her five tips for making your group ride more inclusive. Having been through a variety of group rides myself, I think each one of these seems like great advice.

[You can read the whole thing here](https://lifeontwowheels.squarespace.com/blog-native/2021/1/11/5-tips-for-making-your-group-ride-more-inclusive) on her blog [Life on Two Wheels](https://lifeontwowheels.squarespace.com/home-page). Here’s the summary:

> 1. Be honest about what pace you're going to ride at and stick to it.
> 2. Publish your intended route before the ride.
> 3. Have a sweeper at the back of the ride who knows the route and intended destination.
> 4. Regroup at the top of hills, and actually give the last people up the hill a chance to rest.
> 5. Drop the judgement-based descriptions such as "beginner" or "advanced" when you actually mean slow or fast.

One thing that sticks out to me is how easy each of these should be to follow. For example: you probably know how fast you intend to ride, and you probably know where you’re going, so why not communicate that to everyone? It only takes a small amount thoughtfulness to make the ride better for everyone.
