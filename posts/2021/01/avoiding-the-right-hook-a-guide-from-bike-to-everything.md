Even if you haven’t heard of the “right hook,” you probably know what it is if you’ve ridden a bicycle in car traffic. When a car makes a right turn in front of you, it can cause a scary situation where you’re in danger of a crash. The blog [Bike to Everything](https://biketoeverything.com/2021/01/19/avoid-the-right-hook/) has an excellent guide on how to avoid it.

[You can read the entire guide here](https://biketoeverything.com/2021/01/19/avoid-the-right-hook/). It’s not very long and has pictures. It also breaks the seemingly-simple concept of the right hook into several scenarios that each require a different strategy:

* The usual safest way to avoid the right hook.
* When the car doesn’t merge toward the curb.
* When a right hook is imminent and you need to recover quickly.
* And a bonus scenario: what _drivers_ should do to avoid right hook situations.

I have bike commuted for about five years now and I’ve never thought much about this concept, even though I’ve encountered it. When I’ve been faced with a right hook in the past, I’ve panicked and prayed that I wouldn’t get hit. Seeing the whole strategy neatly laid out now feels enlightening.

That’s one reason why I’m a fan of these kinds of internet guides. Sometimes you just need a simple explainer to give you that lightbulb moment. That’s one reason why I covered [How to Not Get Hit by Cars](https://bicyclesafe.com/) in [a previous post](https://bikewalk.life/2020/09/how-to-not-get-hit-by-cars/), and it’s why I love [Pattie Baker’s TikTok videos](https://travelingatthespeedofbike.com/2021/01/16/you-deserve-joy/). This is the knowledge needs to be democratized.
