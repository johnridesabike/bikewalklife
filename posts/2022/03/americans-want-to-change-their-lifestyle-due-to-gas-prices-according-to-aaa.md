AAA revealed some of their latest survey data on how Americans are reacting to rising gas prices, and it shows that we've reached a threshold.

> Over half (59%) said they would make changes to their driving habits or lifestyle if the cost of gas rose to $4 per gallon. If gas were to reach $5.00, which it has in the Western part of the country, three-quarters said they would need to adjust their lifestyle to offset the spike at the pump.

AAA's analysis into how we can save our personal budgets from gas prices is fairly lukewarm, though. They cite that people will likely carpool and combine trips and errands. They also offer some feeble advice, such as "keep your vehicle in top shape," and "map your route." Thanks, I guess?

Common sense tells us there's a physical limit to how much we can optimize our routes and our engine's performance. Those suggested solutions are still car-dependent, and will still keep us tethered to gas prices in one form or another.

When someone needs to stop their dependency on junk-food, they can't achieve it by only giving up green M&Ms. They need to radically change their entire diet. Likewise, we can't just cut a few of our car trips and expect that to save us from transportation costs. Americans need to look beyond car dependency.
