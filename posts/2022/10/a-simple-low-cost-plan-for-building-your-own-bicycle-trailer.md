For all you DIY aficionados, the Low-Tech Lab website has a new guide for building a bike trailer with hand tools and up-cycled materials. There’s no welding required!

[Read the full guide here: “Simple wooden bike trolley - hand tools only - back wheel attachment.”](https://wiki.lowtechlab.org/wiki/Simple_wooden_bike_trolley_-_hand_tools_only_-_back_wheel_attachment) 

I haven’t had a chance to build it myself, but the instructions look easy, and it includes plenty of diagrams and photos. The author also indicates that they will update this guide as they continue to improve the trailer they made.
