Bike Law has a page that lists the local laws for riding on sidewalk in every State. This is often a confusing topic, which is made more confusing by the fact that many states have vastly different rules about it.

You can read the full list here: [Is It Illegal to Ride Your Bike on the Sidewalk? – Each State’s Answer](https://www.bikelaw.com/2022/08/is-it-illegal-to-ride-bike-on-sidewalk/).

Knowing your state's local law is good to know, but I would also take this information with a grain of salt. My state, Georgia, has this:

> Georgia law considers bicycles as vehicles in all circumstances, which means they are not permitted on sidewalks. The only exceptions are local ordinances that allow individuals ages 12 and under to ride on the sidewalk.

The reality is less clear-cut. It's very common to see riders on sidewalks where I live, and I'm not aware of law enforcement doing anything to stop that. But there are other reasons why it's good to know the letter of the law, for example if you're in an accident and there's a dispute over who is at fault.

There's also a larger question about whether riders _should_ be allowed on sidewalks in general. A lot of these laws are written for streets with a diverse mix of pedestrians and vehicles, and where separating bicycles and pedestrians is obviously safer. In a community that's completely car-oriented, then that safety concern becomes more complicated.

Anecdotally, I've spoken to numerous people who are surprised that I _don't_ ride on a sidewalk normally, and they consider sidewalk riding to be common sense. I believe this is a symptom of, more than anything, our confusing and car-oriented street design.
