Shawn Granton of Urban Adventure League wrote a blog post titled "can Portland style bike fun culture take hold elsewhere?" He reflects on the success and failings of "DIY" bike events hosted by individuals rather than organizations.

> Outside of events where you have to wear a number and booths with bananas and bike mechanics, there could be a few other options: Perhaps there’s a Critical Mass ride, or the night Bike Party version. Maybe an alleycat or two, a race born out of messenger culture. Coffee outsides are popping up here and there as well.

He goes on to describe the multi-decade history of how Portland got to where it is now. One of the takeaways is how much hard work and persistence it takes from volunteers year after year. It's one thing to have an organization host an annual event, but it's another thing to have a critical mass (pun intended) of regular people who are willing to keep the ball rolling organically.

His exact experiences in Portland and Vancouver won't be directly applicable everywhere, but I think his story of successes and failures contains good lessons for everyone.
