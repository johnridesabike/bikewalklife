The League of American Bicyclists has reports based on new data for how Americans are commuting without cars, available on data.bikeleague.org.

[You can read their announcement about these reports here.](https://data.bikeleague.org/first-federal-data-on-pandemic-era-bike-commuting/ )

These reports are especially notable:

* 1.1.3 – [Percentage of Workers who Primarily Bike or Walk to Work Over Time](https://data.bikeleague.org/show-your-data/national-data/rates-of-biking-and-walking/#percentage-of-workers-who-primarily-bike-or-walk-to-work-over-time)
* 1.1.4 – [Number and Percent of People Biking to Work](https://data.bikeleague.org/show-your-data/national-data/rates-of-biking-and-walking/#number-percent-of-people-biking-to-work)
* 1.1.5 – [Number and Percent of People Walking to Work](https://data.bikeleague.org/show-your-data/national-data/rates-of-biking-and-walking/#number-percent-of-people-walking-to-work)

* 3.1.5 – [Chart: 10 Cities with the Most Bike Commuters](https://data.bikeleague.org/show-your-data/city-data/topic-ii-rates-of-active-commuting/#10-cities-with-the-most-bike-commuters)

The data portrays a mixed bag of news. The pandemic era, 2020 and onward, disrupted the status-quo of how people commuted to work. More specifically, many people stopped commuting entirely. With that context, it may not be surprising to see that bicycle and walking commutes also dropped over the last couple of years. 

In many areas, the reduced car traffic and need to get outdoors created a new "bike boom" during the pandemic, where people were riding more than ever. That effect does not seem to spread to commute patterns, at least not that are visible in this data. The announcement notes that this data only represents about 10% of all biking and walking trips.
