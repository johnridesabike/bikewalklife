Fancy Women Bike Ride is an annual event where women dress up in fancy clothes and ride bicycles together. The event celebrates World Car Free Day and pushes for creating welcoming spaces for women to cycle. This year, on September 18, over 209 cities hosted versions of the event. 

The description from their website:

> Every year on World Car Free Day, women will be on the streets with their bikes to show that everyone can ride a bike, and it is even possible to cycle with a fancy dress. Woman’s visibility in urban spaces is key to claim the right to the city. Cycling is a particularly powerful way for women to become visible in the society and a complete new way to interact with the city. Fancy Women Bike Ride is an event for women, organized by women to remember the liberating joy of cycling and to inspire more women to use bicycle in the cities.

The event began in 2013 in Izmir, Turkey. Now it’s grown into an international movement. Several cities in the United States hosted it, including Tampa, Charlotte, and Raleigh in the southeast. All events are organized by local volunteers. If you wish your town had one, maybe you could be the one to make it happen! Their official website has contact information. 

Next year’s Fancy Women Bike Ride will be September 17, 2023.
