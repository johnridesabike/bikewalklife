The 2022 Coffeeneuring Challenge has come to an end, and these are my results. This was my second year documenting my rides through video.

[If you're new to Coffeeneuring, you can read about it here at its official website](https://chasingmailboxes.com/2022/09/24/coffeeneuring-challenge-year-12/).

Last year, I used the Coffeeneuring Challenge as an opportunity to create video documentation of a typical bike ride in my community. [You can see a summary here](https://bikewalk.life/2021/11/biking-for-coffee-coffeeneuring-2021-summary/). For this round, I picked up the GoPro camera again but took a slightly different approach. Instead of hosting on YouTube, I used TikTok (and mirrored the videos on Instagram).

I don't have any strong preferance to any platform, but so far TikTok has been the best at connecting my videos with like-minded bicycle riders. I had to get used to trimming the footage down into bite-size lengths, but that felt like a good exercise for distilling the most valuable essence from it.
