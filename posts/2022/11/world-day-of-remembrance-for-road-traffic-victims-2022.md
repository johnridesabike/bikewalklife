November 20 is World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims. This is a global event to remember the people killed or injured in traffic, to pay tribute to emergency responders, and to advocate for ending traffic violence.

[Find out more on the official website](https://worlddayofremembrance.org/).

People are holding World Day of Remembrance events around the United States and worldwide. [Their site has a list of events here](https://worlddayofremembrance.org/events/). Even if you aren't able to participate in one, then this is also an opportunity to simply help spread the word, for example, on social media (hashtag #WDoR2022).

Traffic violence was once a much more controversial topic here in the US. [We even used build monuments to collectively commemorate its victims](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-06-10/how-cities-responded-to-traffic-deaths-100-years-ago). But, in recent decades, political and corporate interests have been largely successful at normalizing it. With [traffic deaths getting worse year after year](https://smartgrowthamerica.org/dangerous-by-design/), we need every opportunity we can get to reverse this trend.

This blog has often written about the victims of road traffic violence. You can read a few of my articles from the past year:

* [The search for justice continues for Obianuju Osuegbu, the 17-year-old bicycle rider killed in 2020](https://bikewalk.life/2022/04/the-search-for-justice-continues-for-the-17-year-old-bicycle-rider-killed-in-2020-obianuju-osuegbu/)
* [Our transportation system is a disaster to human life, and no one cares](https://bikewalk.life/2022/05/our-transportation-system-is-a-disaster-to-human-life-and-no-one-cares/)
* [Dangerous by Design 2022: traffic deaths are getting worse, especially in the Sun Belt](https://bikewalk.life/2022/07/dangerous-by-design-2022-traffic-deaths-are-getting-worse-especially-in-the-sun-belt/)
* [The “most dangerous road for cyclists in America” gets profiled in Bicycling Magazine](https://bikewalk.life/2022/10/the-most-dangerous-road-for-cyclists-in-america-gets-profiled-in-bicycling-magazine/)

On this year's World Day of Remembrance, we can hope that we will move closer to ending traffic violence worldwide.
