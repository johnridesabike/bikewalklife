A new study aims to quantify the health benefits of a shift to bicycling in 17 countries around the world. In its "ambitious high bike use" scenario, 205,424 early deaths would be prevented globally, with 15,309 of those being in the United States. And those numbers are a conservative estimate.

The paper, published late 2021, is titled [Premature Mortality of 2050 High Bike Use Scenarios in 17 Countries](https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP9073). It analyzes the health benefits of bicycling compared to the risks of traffic violence and breathing air pollution. 

It turns out that the health benefits outweigh everything else, and it's not even close. This chart shows how physical activity saves far more lives than the other risks combined, based on a mere 8% share of bike trips:

This is the first study that's analyzed bicycling's impact on global mortality, and its findings are a conservative estimate based on existing numbers. It's important to recognize that this study doesn't account for other variables, such as how many driver's lives would be saved from fewer crashes or how "vision zero" policies can even protect more people.

One thing that seems clear is that we currently aren't taking the health benefits of bicycling seriously enough.
