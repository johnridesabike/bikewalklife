Bicycle Infrastructure Manuals is a website that hosts documents about (as you may guess) bicycle infrastructure from around the world.

> Here you will find cycling infrastructure design manuals, strategy guides and more all curated from all over the world and organized into one easy-to-use database. Missing anything? Let us know!

This seems like a useful resource for anyone in search of bicycle literature. It also reveals which regions lack such manuals. For example, some US states haven’t had a new bicycle transportation plan in decades, and many have never had one.

In case there are any gaps that the site maintainers have missed, they do have a form for submitting suggestions.
