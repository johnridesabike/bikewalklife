The Atlantic recently published an article by Angie Schmitt which gets right to the point. Our cars are getting bigger and bigger, and traffic deaths are going up as a result.

Read it here: [Big Cars are Killing Americans](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/12/suvs-trucks-killing-pedestrians-cyclists/621102/).

> One common notion—though auto-safety experts will say it’s not that simple—is that it’s safer to get around in what’s basically a tank. But those benefits, exaggerated as they may be, are only for people _inside_ the vehicle. People _outside_—pedestrians, cyclists, wheelchair users—are in more peril.

> In 2003, a [study](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4462-suvs-double-pedestrians-risk-of-death/) found that SUVs were three times more likely than sedans to kill pedestrians when they struck them.

People who keep up with mobility news are probably familiar with Schmitt's advocacy work. It's good to see more mainstream media outlets picking up her message.
