The entire piece is worth reading, but those points stuck out to me. Living
without a car, especially when you walk a lot, requires you to alter your
mindset. A car-centric lifestyle trains you to be impatient, to view other
people as obstacles, and to only focus on how quickly you can reach your
destination. Without a car, you're more rooted in your present moment and your
present place. Meeting people is (or at least can be) a pleasant part of your
day.

When I commute on my bicycle, I gravitate towards routes that have the most
people, whether they're on trails, sidewalks, or front yards. The experience of
waving as you ride past neighbors isn't something that our engineers can
directly build, like they can build bike lanes, but it's still an important part
of living in a healthy community. I've found that most routes can either have
lots of people or lots of cars, but not both.
