The League of American Bicyclists' has organized their "Drive Less, Bike More" challenge for 2022, and their goal is to get Americans to collectively bike for 2 million miles this year.

[Read about Drive Less, Bike more on their official website](https://www.lovetoride.net/drivelessbikemore).

To participate, you need to register a free account and then log any ride you complete. The rides can be for recreation, fun with kids, or commuting. They're especially pushing commuting, and emphasizing how most trips in the US are less than three miles, which makes for an easy bike ride.
