NPR's Bill Chappell published a short reflection on bicycling. "Just like life," he says, "riding my bike doesn't always make sense. But that's why I love it." It's part of their I'm Really Into series. 

[You can read the full essay here](https://www.npr.org/2022/07/18/1089654169/bill-chappell-cycling).

> I make the most and the least sense when I'm riding my bike.
>
> It's one of the rare things in life that lets you escape from the world, while also connecting you to it. I love to spin my way through forests, around lakes, and into little communities I never knew existed.

One thing about bicycles is that everyone has their own connection to them. Even though there are some common reasons why most people ride, each relationship is unique to the individual. I think that personal stories like Bill's are a good way to show how valuable bicycles can be for people.
