  I have believed that one powerful argument in support of transportation reform

  have died, and will continue to die, in part from the volume of cars on our
  roads and how the roads themselves are engineered. But, as damning as that
  sounds, even die-hard car drivers don’t dispute it. Everyone is aware that our

I have believed that one powerful argument in support of transportation reform
is to simply show how deadly our car-centric system is. Millions of people have
died, and will continue to die, in part from the volume of cars on our roads and
how the roads themselves are engineered. But, as damning as that sounds, even
die-hard car drivers don’t dispute it. Everyone is aware that our roads are
deadly. They just don’t care.

Imagine if the US federal government instituted a giant project that impacted
every single neighborhood in every single town in the entire nation. Then,
decades later, a whistleblower exposed that this Big Government project had been
directly responsible for millions of deaths. It’s not hard to imagine what would
follow: protests, campaigns for defunding, and investigations into the project’s
officials.

Yet, in the real-life version of this story, the scandalous data has always been
out in the open. People are so unfazed that the government itself even
_advertises_ it:

Our officials normally put those kinds of warnings on things that they want
people to avoid, like tobacco products, but here our government is advertising
how deadly its own infrastructure is. No one cares.

Maybe you think that you’re an exception, that you _do_ care. Then I challenge
you to ask yourself: does your concern truly match the seriousness of this
issue? Do millions of deaths caused by a government project scandalize you? Have
you written letters to your officials? Have you marched in the streets? Or is it
just another bullet point on your list of reasons for reform in general?

This deadliness has become so normalized that it doesn’t even come up often
among people who support transportation reforms. More commonly, we base our
anti-car arguments around climate change, physical health, and monetary cost.
(Just to be clear, those are good topics too.) When we do talk about traffic
violence, we never treat it like it’s a scandal.

I believe that one element to this phenomenon is a failure of imagination.
[As I wrote before, people have trouble even imagining a version of their community that’s not car-centric](https://bikewalk.life/2022/02/investing-in-imagination/).
We can envision a world without wars, without taxes, and without gun violence,
but not without cars. Sure, maybe those multi-lane roads through our
neighborhoods are loud, ugly, and literally killing people, but the alternative,
a world without those roads, seems absurd. It’s easier to convince ourselves
that the status-quo is fine.

Our roads are very deadly. No one disputes that fact, so our only disagreement
comes from a matter of perspective. Is millions of traffic deaths “just how it
goes” or is it an unconscionable scandal? Is each death the victim’s fault, is
it just an accident, or is it all of our faults for allowing this deadly system?
I don’t know any easy way to change the public’s perspective, but we can start
by treating the situation with the severity that it deserves.
