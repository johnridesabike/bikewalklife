I love just-for-fun bicycle challenges. They embody what bicycles are really about for me: having fun, building relationships, and just going outside to live life. Here’s one coming up soon: [Midnite Bicycle League Challenge](https://urbanadventureleague.wordpress.com/2020/11/11/announcing-the-midnite-bicycle-league-2020-21-challenge-1-dec-2020-28-feb-2021/) hosted by Urban Adventure League.

> It’s pretty simple:
>
> * Ride your bike at night
> * Each ride at least 3 mi/5 km
> * Five times during the Challenge
> * You can do a maximum of two rides in a week
> * And you must do rides over two months during the Challenge
>
> **_The Midnite Bicycle League Challenge will happen from 1 December 2020 to 28 February 2021. All times local._**

There is a small fee to join, but that seems to mainly just cover the cost of the the materials. You get a fancy journal to log your rides.

Some people aren’t eager to ride at night, which I can understand. The [Errandonnee challenge](https://chasingmailboxes.com/category/errandonnee/) used to have a requirement to do a at least one ride at night, but removed it since there were some riders who _never_ want to ride in the dark. I personally ride in the dark a lot, especially as I commute in the winter months. I know it can be a much different experience, but I wouldn’t discourage anyone from trying it.

The MBLC only requires five rides over two months, which seems quite doable to me. Just make sure you have a headlight, and bring a buddy!
