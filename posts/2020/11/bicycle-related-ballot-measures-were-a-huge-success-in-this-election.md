[People for Bikes](https://peopleforbikes.org/) tracked bicycle-related ballot measures for 2020. [Now, as the election wraps up, they have the results.](https://peopleforbikes.org/2020ballottracker/)

The most noticeable detail is that almost all of the measures were successful. There were 48 measures across 17 states, and only 5 didn’t pass. Almost all of those failures lost by very small margins. A \~90% hit rate looks great from my perspective.

I wish I could offer more insight into the measures, but the vastness of the landscape makes that a challenge (truly an embarrassment of riches). But if there’s one thing that seems certain, it’s that bicycles are very popular among voters across the country.

This seems like a clear signal for us to strike while the iron is hot and push forward with more bicycle projects.
