November 15 is [World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims](https://worlddayofremembrance.org/). From the official site:

> The objectives of WDoR 2020 are to provide a platform for road traffic victims and their families to:
>
> * remember all people killed and seriously injured on the roads;
> * acknowledge the crucial work of the emergency services;
> * draw attention to the generally trivial legal response to culpable road deaths and injuries
> * advocate for better support for road traffic victims and victim families;
> * promote evidence-based actions to prevent and eventually stop further road traffic deaths and injuries

I am not aware of any organizations observing it here in the southeast (I would love to be shown otherwise), but with our pandemic-laden virtual world, that may be mostly moot anyway. The official social media hashtag is **#WDoR2020**.

I certainly hope that observances like these continue to gain steam. It’s a great antidote to [fiascos like NHTSA’s “pedestrian safety month.”](/2020/10/streetsblog-debunks-pedestrian-safety-myths/)
