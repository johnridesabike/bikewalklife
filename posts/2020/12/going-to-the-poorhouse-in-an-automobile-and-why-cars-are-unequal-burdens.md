There is a [great blog post by Todd Litman on Planetizen](https://www.planetizen.com/blogs/111535-automobile-dependency-unequal-burden) about why car dependency is a major factor in fueling poverty.

> For example, [thousands of automobiles](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/thousands-line-up-in-dallas-texas-to-receive-food-ahead-of-thanksgiving-food-bank-donation/) regularly line up to receive food bank packages, as illustrated in the photo above.
>
> These are mostly nice SUVs, light trucks and vans, the types of vehicles owned by responsible families living in automobile-dependent communities. Automobile food bank lines are, to a large degree, a self-fulfilling prophesy: Because residents must drive everywhere, they have high transportation costs, leaving inadequate money for other essentials like food, shelter and healthcare, which forces them to depend on charity. Many of these families would not need food bank help if they could cut their vehicle expenses in half, saving $250-500 per month, but that is often infeasible because they lack affordable mobility options. This is one example of the inefficiencies and unfairness of an automobile-dependent transportation system.

He makes a convincing argument. I recommend reading the whole thing.
