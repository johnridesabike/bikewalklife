There is a [great blog post by Todd Litman on Planetizen](https://www.planetizen.com/blogs/111535-automobile-dependency-unequal-burden) about why car dependency is a major factor in fueling poverty:

> Entertainer Will Rogers once noted that, "The United States is the only country ever to go to the poorhouse in an automobile." This has become tragically true for many low- and moderate-income families.
>
> For example, [thousands of automobiles](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/thousands-line-up-in-dallas-texas-to-receive-food-ahead-of-thanksgiving-food-bank-donation/) regularly line up to receive food bank packages, as illustrated in the photo above.
>
> These are mostly nice SUVs, light trucks and vans, the types of vehicles owned by responsible families living in automobile-dependent communities. Automobile food bank lines are, to a large degree, a self-fulfilling prophesy: Because residents must drive everywhere, they have high transportation costs, leaving inadequate money for other essentials like food, shelter and healthcare, which forces them to depend on charity.

He writes a convincing argument, and I recommend reading the whole article. One of our biggest collective mistakes has been making car ownership the entry-fee for participating in society.
