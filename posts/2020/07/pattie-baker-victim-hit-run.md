Pattie Baker has been an influencial and inspirational figure in bike advocacy.
If there's any silver lining to this story, it's at least that it is drawing
attention to the seriousness of bicycle safety.

> Dear Mayor and City Council: I want you to know I am lucky to be alive after being the victim of a hit-and-run crime on Tilly Mill Road today while riding my bike home. I was able to call 911 and report it. Response by police and paramedics was swift and respectful, which was appreciated.
>
> City of Dunwoody Officer Forman is trying to identify the owner of the car in order to press appropriate charges, which I expect will include the expanded charges under the Vulnerable Road User ordinance.
