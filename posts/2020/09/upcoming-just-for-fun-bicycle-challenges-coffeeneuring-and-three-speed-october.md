I’m always game for an old-fashioned, just-for-fun, bicycle challenge. Sure the Bike League’s big National Bike Challenge and city events like [Atlanta’s Biketober](https://www.lovetoride.net/atlanta?locale=en-US) are great, but there’s something special about the low-stakes, high-fun challenges that are run by ordinary people on the blogosphere and social media. Two of these are coming up for October: Coffeeneuring and Three Speed October.

## [Coffeeneuring Challenge](https://chasingmailboxes.com/2020/09/27/coffeeneuring-challenge-2020-one-good-thing/)

Coffeeneuring has been one of my favorite annual challenges for a while. The premise is simple: ride a bike to spots where you drink your beverage of choice (e.g. coffee). If you do this enough and take photos to prove it, you’ll earn a fabulous prize.

From the official rules:

> Essentially the challenge boils down to this:
>
> * over the course of 7’ish weeks,
> * ride your bike to 7 different places,
> * at least 2 miles round trip each time,
> * drink 7 cups of coffee (or similar), and
> * take 7 pictures (or other documentation) as proof of your coffeeneuring.

[Read more about how to participate in Coffeeneuring here](https://chasingmailboxes.com/2020/09/27/coffeeneuring-challenge-2020-one-good-thing/).

It begins on Saturday, October 10th. It’s free to participate, although you need to cover the cost of your prize if you want one.

## [Three Speed October](https://societyofthreespeeds.wordpress.com/2020/09/25/three-speed-october-2020-starts-today/)

This one is new to me. The Society of Three Speeds manages it, and its rules are simple:

> From now until Sunday November 1st:
>
> 1. Ride a _three speed bicycle_
> 2. _Three times a week_
> 3. At least _three miles_ (5 km) each trip
> 4. For _at least three weeks_ during the duration of the challenge
> 5. During a five-week period that centers around the month of October

This challenge does have an entry fee ($17 to $22), but that cost covers your materials, including your prize and an official reporting journal. Swanky.

Three Speed October has officially started already. Sadly, I do not ride a three-speed bicycle, so I cannot participate.
