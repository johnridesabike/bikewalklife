> [The Burley Travoy®](https://www.burley.com/product/travoy/) is impressive. If I don’t win the #CarryShitOlympics with this thing, I deserve a podium spot at least. It’s super steady, not super wide, and didn’t even flinch when I was doing crit turns on a road bike. I went for it at full speed, and the trailer came right along with me.
