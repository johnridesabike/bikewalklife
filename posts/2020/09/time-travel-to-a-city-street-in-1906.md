When you’ve always lived in a car-dominated society, it may be hard to imagine how life could exist any other way. But contrary to popular perception, modern car-culture is an aberration in the natural order of things. We even have video to help prove it.

[![Watch video: “\[4k, 60 fps\] San Francisco, a Trip down Market Street, April 14, 1906” ](https://res.cloudinary.com/bike-walk-life/image/upload/t_md_body_retina/f_auto/v1610553036/2020/4k-60-fps-san-francisco-a-trip-down-market-street-april-14-1906-vo_1adyrgw8_4.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VO_1AdYRGW8)

Denis Shiryaev took the 1906 film “A Trip Down Market Street” and restored it by upscaling the resolution to 4K, dubbing sound effects, colorizing it, and more. [You can watch it here: “\[4k, 60 fps\] San Francisco, a Trip down Market Street, April 14, 1906”](https://youtu.be/VO_1AdYRGW8). This version is not only technically impressive, it reveals with new clarity just how different our streets once were.

[Arian Horbovetz has an excellent analysis on Strong Towns](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2020/8/28/when-streets-were-for-everyone):

> **Lesson #1. Multiple Modes of Mobility:** Trolleys, carriages, bikes, cars and pedestrians—count the number of different forms of mobility in this video. The streets were truly for everyone, regardless of speed, size, or socioeconomic status.
>
> **Lesson #2. Similar Speed:** Equitable transportation is rooted in the idea that anyone can access jobs and resources equally, regardless of their socioeconomic status. In this video, pedestrians, mass transit and cars move at a similar speed. The difference in velocity between the most exclusive form of transportation and the most humble form of transportation is negligible. Today, the average 15-minute commute by car is likely to be over an hour by bus. The [prioritization of the automobile](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2018/7/2/we-should-be-building-cities-for-people-not-cars) has completely eradicated equitable access to jobs and resources.
>
> **Lesson #3. Density and Community:** Slower, more equitable mobility leads to greater, more efficient urban density. Suburban expansion has created an inequitable construct based on “pay-to-play” access of upwardly mobile resources. When multi-modal transportation is encouraged, more efficient and equitable communities are possible.

As we can see now in vibrant 4K video, these ideals aren’t just theoretical.
