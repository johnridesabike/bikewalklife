[Streetsblog has a new article with a video](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2020/08/04/video-how-car-dominance-makes-non-white-neighborhoods-hotter/) about the heat islands within our cities.

> As summer heat rages across America, some neighborhoods are substantially hotter than others — thanks to the legacies of racist transportation policies that still affect our cities.
>
> In a new video, Grist explores how decades of racist (and fully legal) policies, such as discriminatory mortgage lending, resulted in rampant disinvestment in non-white communities — which especially hurt mostly Black, downtown neighborhoods, which became prime targets for clearance so that planners could build the federal highway system.

This research isn't quite breaking news. [You can read NPR’s report from January which includes charts of the data](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/14/795961381/racist-housing-practices-from-the-1930s-linked-to-hotter-neighborhoods-today). My own city is in the top ten.

And the reality behind the data certainly isn't news to anyone who lives in a city and who travels sans car. When you're on foot or on bike, the difference in temperature between neighborhoods is drastic.
